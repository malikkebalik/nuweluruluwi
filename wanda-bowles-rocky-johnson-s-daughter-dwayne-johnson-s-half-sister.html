He was dating&nbsp;<strong>Ata Fitisemanu Maivia</strong>, the daughter of a professional wrestler,&nbsp;Peter Maivia.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2022/12/29/Cyej3XCW8AAxZTw%20(1)-1672297177260.jpg><p>According to the Maivia statement, Ata and Rocky first met at the wrestling hall. Peter and Rocky were a tag team. At that time, he became a father, but the newly born child's mother was not Una Sparks; that was Peter Maivia's daughter, Ata Fitisemanu Maivia.</p><p>The newborn child was&nbsp;Dwayne Johnson, born on May 2, 1972. Six years before the Una and Jhonson divorce. However, the new child's mother, Ata Maivia, disapproved of her relationship with Rocky.&nbsp;</p><p>Nevertheless, the claim she made was recognized as wrong. The mayhem over it hardly makes us think of two conclusions. Either Jhonson cheated on Una or separated at Rocky's third child delivery. The truth remained a mystery. Till now, people have yet to learn the truth behind it.&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>Stay Tuned With Us:&nbsp;</strong></i><a href=#><i><strong>Married Celeb</strong></i></a><i><strong>.</strong></i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDnJylnZJjsLC5jrCYp5yRYq%2Bww8ueqg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-untold-truth-of-katelyn-jae-brown-kane-brown-s-wife.html><span>←</span><span>The Untold Truth of Katelyn Jae Brown, Kane Brown's Wife</span></a>
