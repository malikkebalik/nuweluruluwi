Here’s everything you need to know about Raven Symone’s weight reduction journey, including how she lost weight and more.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Who Is Raven Symone?</strong></h2><p>Raven Symone was born December 10, 1985, and is an actress, singer, model, and talk show host from the United States. She was a well-known child performer during her time. Symone began her career as a child model, modeling for some of America’s most well-known companies as early as the age of ten, and it wasn’t long before she was cast in films.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100% rel=noopener>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none rel=noopener>A post shared by Raven-Symoné (@ravensymone)</a></p></figure><p>She made her acting debut in one of Bill Cosby’s flicks and hasn’t looked back since. On the other hand, she is a rare talent singer who has released four albums of her own, all of which have become blockbusters; in fact, she released her first album when she was just ten years old.</p><p>She played Raven Baxter in the Disney sitcom ‘That’s So Raven,’ which was one of the most popular series ever produced by Disney for a long time. Symone is a well-known child artist who went on to become a well-known actress, singer, and model.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Raven Symone Weight Loss Journey</strong></h2><p>Raven-Symoné lost 40 pounds thanks to the help of her wife, Miranda Pearman-Maday, and a sugar-free diet.</p><p>“She helped me kick sugar with her advice and guidance and love and wonderful cooking abilities,” Symoné, 36, said on “The View” with Pearman-Maday on Wednesday.</p><p>“I say kick sugar because it’s an addictive drug, and I used to be addicted to it in wheat form, regular form.” “And it’s out of my system,” she said, explaining that she was using to eat a “fish filet with an additional packet of ketchup – two on Fridays because they’re cheaper!”</p><p>Because of her wife, the former “That’s So Raven” star decided to get serious about her health. She pointed at Pearman-Maday and added, “What made me want to change was her.”</p><p>Symoné explained that she had received some bad news from her doctor and that she wanted to get her health under control so that she and her partner could have a long and happy life together.</p><p>She stated, “I want to be here for her as long as I can.” “At the doctor, I learned some numbers that were not nice for someone my age — or anyone’s age, to be honest with you.” The actress claims she was able to accomplish the transformation without exercising because she changed her diet.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Raven Symone Before & After pictures</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecurrent-online.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Raven-Symone-Before-After-.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecurrent-online.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Raven-Symone-Before-After-pictures.jpg><p><strong>Read More: </strong><a title="Randy Jackson Weight Loss Surgery: Did Randy Jackson Undergo Surgery To Lose Weight?" href=# rel=bookmark>Randy Jackson Weight Loss Surgery: Did Randy Jackson Undergo Surgery To Lose Weight?</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>How Did Raven Symone 40- Pound Weight Loss?</strong></h2><p>On Wednesday’s episode of The View, Raven-Symone revealed one of the secrets to her spectacular 40-pound weight loss.</p><p>The 36-year-old hailed her wife Miranda Pearman-Maday, 34, who appeared on the chat show with her, for assisting her in reducing her sugar intake.</p><p>‘With [my wife’s] counsel, direction, and love, as well as her wonderful cooking talents — which everyone here knows — she helped me ditch sugar,’ she said before describing sugar as a “drug.”</p><p>‘I suggest kick sugar because it’s a highly addictive substance.’ ‘I was addicted to it in wheat form, regular form, and it’s out of my system now,’ the Disney Channel actress added.</p><p>Her sugar intake was also disguised as a ‘fish filet with an additional packet of ketchup – two on Fridays!’ she laughed. Raven emphasized that the cookies she eats are ‘keto-friendly,’ and that her diet consists primarily of ‘healthy food.’</p><p>‘And I start talking to someone about fasting every day here at The View because I’m an intermittent and extended faster,’ she continued.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Raven Symone Personal Life</strong></h2><p>Raven-Symoné said in August 2013 that she was “glad to learn today that more states allowed homos*xual marriage” and that it was “wonderful to know may now, should wish to.”</p><p>She emphasized her rejection of labels and identifying as African-American or LGBT in an October 2014 interview with Oprah Winfrey, stating that she was an “American” and a “person who loves humans.” The 2016 Montreal Pride Parade nominated her as Grand Marshal.</p><p>Between 2012 and 2015, Raven-Symoné married model and actress AzMarie Livingston.
