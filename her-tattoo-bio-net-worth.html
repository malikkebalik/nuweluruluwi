Though she started off her career in television, she is popping off as a singer and songwriter. Nonetheless, she is going headstrong in the entertainment industry.</p><h2>Why Did Moriah Plath Breakup With Max?</h2><p>If you've watched <i>Welcome To Plathville,</i> you already know that the Plath kids are not allowed to date. However, against the odds, Moriah Plath decided to date <strong>Max Kallschmidt</strong>. They made their relationship official through Instagram on <strong>June 2020</strong>.</p><figure class=media></figure><p>The pair reportedly met through Marsha Doll, whom Micah Plath, her brother, had worked with. Though her brother, Ethan Plath's wife, Olivia Plath, had difficulty getting accepted, the Plath couple seemed to like Max. And Max even gave her a promise ring. So, Moriah's fans were happy for her to start a relationship.</p><p>However, the couple soon broke out the news of their breakup. And the <strong>reason </strong>for the breakup was that Max cheated on Moriah. Moreover, back on February 12, 2022, Max even posted a video of "Tell All" about their relationship. He said that he was being pressured into the relationship. But Moriah later revealed the truth that nothing of the sort happened. So, the video was taken down.</p><h3>Plath Kids Are Homeschooled</h3><p>In case you didn't know, all the Plath kids had to get homeschooled whether they wanted to or not.
