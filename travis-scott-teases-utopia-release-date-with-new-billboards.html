One billboard right outside the Sunset Strip’s Chateau Marmont reads: “IS IT IN THE CHATEAU?” Another, posted right above a liquor store in West Hollywood, says: “IS IT IN THE LIQUOR STORE?”</p><p>In addition to the findutopia.com&nbsp;text (which leads to <a href=# rel=noopener>Scott’s official website</a>), both signs feature a round object with two wooden arms that resemble a clock. Around it, instead of the numbers for each hour, are disproportionate, claymation-style heads.</p>AD<p>AD LOADING...</p><p>Another billboard design features a combination lock, referencing the “Utopia” briefcases that Scott’s been using to promote his next release. The code is locked on 07211, which many believe hints at a potential release date of July 21.</p><p>Check out the billboards below:</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Travis Scott teases "Utopia" release date with new Billboards <a href=#>https://t.co/52WCdDsvQr</a><a href=#>pic.twitter.com/q9lSk1Pk6U</a></p><p>— HipHopDX (@HipHopDX) <a href=#>June 28, 2023</a></p><p>The anticipation for Utopia has been building up over the past few years, but 2023 seems like the closest fans have been to an actual release.</p><p>In mid-June, the “90210” rapper stepped outside London’s Abbey Road studios to a crowd of fans and put on a quick performance piece with his security team. They proceeded to cross the street maintaining equal distance from one another, <a class=underline-link href=#>recreating the cover art of the iconic Beatles album, Abbey Road</a>. The security guard right in front of Scott was spotted holding a “Utopia” briefcase.</p>AD<p>AD LOADING...</p><p>This prop has been sighted in recent images of the 32-year-old and is seen by many as a sign that the new album is right around the corner.</p><p>Scott also recently appeared in a <a class=underline-link href=#>Nike commercial alongside John McEnroe</a> to promote the release of the “Mac Attack” sneakers. As part of the campaign, the two were <a href=# rel=noopener>photographed</a> together, with the trap prince holding the mystery briefcase.</p><a class=related-article--container href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.hiphopdx.com/2023/06/kid-cudi-promises-travis-scott-collabs-on-insano-despite-scrapping-joint-album-250x142.jpg alt="Kid Cudi Promises Travis Scott Collabs On 'Insano' Despite Scrapping Joint Album" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=related-article--tagline>related<span> news</span></p><h3 class=related-article--title>Kid Cudi Promises Travis Scott Collabs On 'Insano' Despite Scrapping Joint Album</h3><p class=related-article--meta-information>June 27, 2023</p></a><p>Prior to that, record producer <a class=underline-link href=#>Mike Dean posted a photo to Instagram</a> that showed him posing with the briefcase open, but only for his eyes to see what was inside and not fans. “What’s in the case?” he captioned the post.</p><p><a class=underline-link href=#>Scott’s security guards have been seen carrying the item</a> during most of his public appearances of late. Similar to the “Utopia” message that has been seen at the bottom of his shoes, the briefcase has the word written in Scott’s handwriting on the front.</p>AD<p>AD LOADING...</p><p>This led to speculation that the briefcase contains the master copy of the upcoming record, with a source close to the rapper telling <a href=# rel=noopener>TMZ</a> that Scott plans to unveil the full album “sometime this summer.”</p><p>Scott and his team are back at it and teasing fans about the whereabouts of the album, and the excitement surrounding it is at an all-time high.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmigmaW1sLzDsWWcp51ku6bD0mirq5mmnsBuv8Koq61lpam8sbXAZpmipJyXvKK%2Bw6w%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./rocko.html><span>←</span><span>Rocko</span></a>
