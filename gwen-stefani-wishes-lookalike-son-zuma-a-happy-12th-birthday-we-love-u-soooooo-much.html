Gwen took to Instagram to celebrate the major milestone. “happy birthday to my ZUMA i can’t believe u r 12 years old today!! we love u sooooooo much!!” she captioned her carousel post. The images, posted on August 22, featured little Zuma with long blonde hair looking&nbsp;so&nbsp;much like his mom! Gwen also included some more recent pics of her son, in which he sported a shorter, more brunette hairstyle.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>“So adorable all three of your children look just like you! Good looking boys! Happy birthday Zuma,” one fan commented on the post, while another wrote, “Happy Birthday to the sweetest and coolest little boy! Hope you had a fun filled day, Zuma!” The&nbsp;<strong>No Doubt&nbsp;</strong>star has done a great job co-parenting Zuma and his bros <strong>Kingston</strong>, 14, and&nbsp;<strong>Apollo</strong>, 6, whom she shares with ex <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Gavin Rossdale</strong></a>. But it seems her beau Blake has also been playing a major role in their upbringing!</p><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100% rel=nofollow>View this post on Instagram<p id=content-paragraph-4></p></a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>happy birthday to my ZUMA i can’t believe u r 12 years old today!! we love u sooooooo much!! gx</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Gwen Stefani</a> (@gwenstefani) on Aug 21, 2020 at 8:21pm PDT</p><p id=content-paragraph-5></p><p id=content-paragraph-6>“Blake is a fun guy who is completely natural with&nbsp;Gwen‘s kids,” a source <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>revealed to&nbsp;<strong>HollywoodLife</strong></a> exclusively last week. “At first, it was weird and difficult and Blake tried to weather any emotions and storms that came to him and listened to Gwen&nbsp;on how to adapt.
