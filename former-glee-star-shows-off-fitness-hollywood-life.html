The actor is best known for playing wheelchair-bound Artie Abrams on Fox’s Glee and he is leaving that character behind in favor of hour-long, super intense gym sessions.&nbsp;He is training at UP Los Angeles and the results are shocking!</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>“I come here three times a week and work out for an hour. It sounds too good to be true, but that’s just it. You eat healthy and you come here and train hard,”&nbsp;Kevin told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Extra</a>‘s Renee Bargh. Kevin has been training with UP Los Angeles CEO Nick Mitchell and he credits the one on one time with a personal trainer for his transformation.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>The actor also recently came out as gay, with a little help from Ariana Grande I might add. Kevin took to Twitter after the release of Ariana’s hit song, “No Tears Left To Cry” to say, “<span class=twitter-hashflag-container>#NoTearsLeftToCry</span>&nbsp;is gayer than me and I ACCEPT. Ty&nbsp;@ArianaGrande.” We accept too! Kevin is living his best life and seems to have also found a hot new boyfriend. Fans speculated that Kevin was seeing someone before he officially came out, because of certain images Kevin shared with a mystery man on Instagram. Kevin’s rumored “boy” is actor Austin P. McKenzie and the two could not be cuter.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Kevin recently gave props to his alleged boyfriend on Instagram for his birthday on Aug 24, writing, “Happy 1/2 way to 50 to the cutest boy in the world.” I can’t wait to see more from these two. Adorbs!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWloZH15e5FxZqSdpp67brnCoZilnV2YvK6x0mamrqxdnLmmsYyfoK2mlajAbsDRmqWsnp%2BnuqLAyKilaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./choi-hyun-suk-height-weight-age-girlfriend-family-facts-biography.html><span>←</span><span>Choi Hyun-suk Height, Weight, Age, Girlfriend, Family, Facts, Biography</span></a>
