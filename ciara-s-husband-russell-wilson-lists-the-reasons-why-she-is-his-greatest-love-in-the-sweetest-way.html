The lyrics read, "I should’ve known when you took my son as your own / I ain’t saying I ain’t like all the carats and the stone / It’s just your love that I want / Now it’s you and me against, ‘gainst the entire world, the entire world / I see our love when I look at our baby girl, I’m a lucky girl.”</p><p class=Zg>Her new song came with a lovely music video that showed the singer performing in an array of beautiful outfits. It is her third single off of her upcoming album, following "Dose" and "Level Up."</p><p class=Zg>Supporting his wife and her newly released single, Russel made his own video, sharing his own reasons why Ciara is his greatest love. Before anything else, he said that she makes the world a better place and inspires him to do good. He then goes on to say how wonderful she is as a mother, doing anything and everything for their two kids. Lastly, it's that she makes him a better man. Wilson says that his wife strengthens her faith, and it's what makes their love work.</p><p class=Zg>Ciara made sure to let her husband know how happy he's made her, saying that his video made her face hurt from smiling.
