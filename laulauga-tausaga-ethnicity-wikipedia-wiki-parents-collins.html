She then sprinted into the crowd to rejoice with her fans.</p><p>I wasn’t able to do something tonight that I didn’t think was possible, Tausaga said. “I don’t know if I have a fairy godmother or my ancestors had some say in it,” Tausaga said.</p><p>“I was confident that if I was at the top of my game, I could sneak into a medal position and not finish 12th as I did in the last two world championships,” the athlete said. I won a gold medal; it’s so unbelievable to me. I simply couldn’t get to my coach quickly enough to give him the biggest embrace of my life after I realized how far away we were.</p><p>Olympic champion Allman was determined to avoid a repetition of last year when she was the hot favourite but only managed third place behind surprise victor Feng Bin of China. Allman had the top six throws of the season, the best almost three meters farther than everyone else in the competition.</p><p>Allman established her dominance over the Budapest competition, unlike in Eugene, with a first-round throw of 68.57, which was further than any of her competitors had managed all year. Before her teammate stepped in, she had raised those marks to 68.79 in the third round and 69.23 in the fourth, and she appeared to be headed for the gold.</p><p>Tausaga, who was born in Hawaii, had achieved a personal best time of 65.56, but it wasn’t much of a deal because it maintained her in sixth place at the halfway stage.</p><p>After Tausaga’s final throw, Allman had one last opportunity to retake the lead but failed, leaving her countrywoman to take the winning throw, which she completed while wiping tears from her face.</p><p>Tausaga remarked, “I can’t tell you what it means right now because I still can’t believe it. I cannot express the emotions I am feeling. It’s incredible.</p><p>Allman expressed her disappointment while also paying respect to her comrade.</p><p>It is no secret that I wanted to win tonight, stated Allman. “I have been working extremely hard in my training, giving it my all to win. When you are in excellent shape but are unable to win the gold medal, it is difficult. A one-two for the USA is also very unique, and being next to Laulauga makes me feel incredibly happy to be standing on the podium.</p><p>With a throw of 68.20 in the last round, Feng won the bronze.</p><p><strong>Also Read :</strong></p><ul><li><a href=#>Meghan Markle Divorce Wikipedia, Wiki, Engagement Ring, Age, Net Worth</a></li><li><a href=#>Michael Popok Wikipedia, Wiki, Attorney, Bio, Podcast, Education</a></li><li><a href=#>Jill Simonian Wikipedia, Wiki, Husband, Instagram, Bio</a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmignpe0tnrNnqtopJGquaLBxppkrZmlqK6orY4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kristy-titus.html><span>←</span><span>Kristy Titus</span></a>
