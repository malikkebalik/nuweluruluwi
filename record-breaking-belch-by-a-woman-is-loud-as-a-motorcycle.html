Kimberly Winter of Spotsylvania, Virginia, now holds the Guinness World Record for the world’s loudest burp by a woman as her enormous belch is about as loud as a motorcycle at full throttle.
Winter, 33, also known as @Kimycola on TikTok, broke the record on April 28, she told The Post on Wednesday, with a bellowing belch that was 107.3 decibels loud.
That means her sweet music is louder than a blender (70-80 dB), an electric handheld drill (90-95 dB) and even some motorcycles at full throttle (100-110 dB) according to GWR."><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
