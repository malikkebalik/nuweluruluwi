Gigi looked amazing in this summer’s hottest trend – <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>tie dye</a>. She opted to wear head-to-toe <strong>Cotton Citizen</strong>, featuring a skintight hot pink and white dyed <strong>Venice Crop Tank</strong> which she paired with the matching high-waisted <strong>Milan Biker Shorts</strong>. The shorts were skintight and ended high up on her thighs, while she showed off her super tiny waist and rock hard abs in this ensemble. Gigi tied a gray <strong>Cotton Citizen Brooklyn Oversized Crewneck</strong> sweatshirt around her waist and accessorized with a pair of gold <strong>Vogue x Gigi Hadid 4139 Sunglasses</strong> attached to an <strong>Eliou Samos Sunglasses Leash</strong>, a <strong>Missoma Axiom Chain Necklace</strong>, the <strong>ASH Extreme Sneakers</strong> in white with high white ankle socks, and a <strong>Prada Nylon Backpack</strong>. As for her glam, Gigi threw her wavy blonde hair up into a super high messy bun, which is also a major <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>summer hair trend</a>, leaving a few pieces of hair out in front of her face.</p><p id=content-paragraph-2>Meanwhile, Bella, opted for a super casual but revealing look when she threw on a pair of low-rise black sweat shorts. She paired the baggy Brandy Melville Rosa Sweatshorts with a super tiny and tight <strong>UNIF To-Go Tank</strong>, which was more like a bralette than a crop top. The tiny top featured leopard print spaghetti straps and was lined in animal print, while the rest of her unbelievable toned tummy was on full display. She accessorized the casual but sexy look with a pair of high white ankle socks, chunky black <strong>Burberry Ronnie Sneakers</strong>, a <strong>LAJOUX</strong> custom “Bella” <strong>Diamond Name Necklace</strong>, a <strong>Jacquie Aiche Necklace</strong>, an <strong>Alezan by Sk Necklace</strong>, and her favorite pair of heart-shaped <strong>Frasier Sterling Lovers Hoop Earrings</strong>. She topped her look off with a pair of <strong>Oliver Peoples Daveigh Sunglasses</strong> and a cute little <strong>Louis Vuitton Panda Monogram Pochette</strong> purse.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Both sisters looked effortlessly chic in their outfits, and they were right on trend with these looks. Not only is tie dye a huge trend this summer, so are biker shorts, which Gigi rocked. Plus, Bella’s good friend, <strong>Hailey Baldwin</strong>, 22, just rocked a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>similar pair of shorts</a> as Bella’s, on June 3 in West Hollywood.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/gigi-bella-hadid-stun-in-crop-tops-shorts-sets-for-girls-trip-to-disneyland-embed-01.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>Hailey rocked a super short white cropped T-shirt styled with a pair of baggy gray <strong>Umbro</strong> sweat-shorts that she kept low on her hips. She accessorized her gym attire with a pair of black <strong>Celine Cl41468 Edge Sunglasses</strong>, a <strong>Jennifer Meyer 3 Prong Diamond Necklace</strong>, and a pair of black sneakers. She chose to put her toned rock hard abs on full display in this look, leaving the elastic band of the shorts super low-rise.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWlpZH14e49xZqChl556o7HLpZhmoJGZtqV5wJuqZpuipL1uwM6pqmarmKS%2Ftb%2BMnaCsppWuuaK6w2g%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./thelma-riley-bio-age-net-worth-relationship-career.html><span>←</span><span>Thelma Riley | Bio, Age, Net Worth, Relationship, Career</span></a>
