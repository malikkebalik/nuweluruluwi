amenities, including seven bedrooms and an infinity pool.</p><p>On April 25, however, process servers brought court papers to Castro’s home, in a suit claiming the winning ticket was stolen.</p><p>Jose Rivera claims <a href=#>he purchased the winning ticket </a>on Nov. 7, 2022, the day before the drawing.</p><p>Rivera is suing Castro and his former landlord Urachi “Reggie” Romero, who he claims stole his ticket and told him it was a “loser.”</p><p>Romero has denied <a href=#>stealing the ticket</a> but supported Rivera’s claim that he was the rightful ticket holder.</p><p>California Lottery officials said they are confident Castro is the rightful winner.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong><a href=#>READ MORE</a></strong></h3><p>The Japanese-style pad

rotation of three guards who protect him and his home around the clock.</p><p>He has not done any media interviews since his life-changing win but released a statement that Powerball officials read when they announced the winner.</p><p>“As much as I am shocked and ecstatic to have won the Powerball drawing, the real winner is the California public school system,” he said in the statement.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Castro has not done any interviews with the media since coming into the massive fortune. <span
