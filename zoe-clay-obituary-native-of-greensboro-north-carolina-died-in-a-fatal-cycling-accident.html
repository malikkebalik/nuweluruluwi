Zoe, our youngest participant, was just 23 years old when she was involved in a fatal cycling accident in Greensboro, North Carolina on Monday, October 8, 2023. Zoe’s connection to Camp DoReMi began through her father, Tom Clay, who served as a Caretaker at Wildacres Retreat.</p><p>Tom played an instrumental role in ensuring our involvement at Wildacres for the camp in 2007. Although the Clay family relocated to Crozet, Virginia just before the inaugural camp, they returned the following year. Zoe, at the tender age of 8, expressed her deep love for Wildacres, a place she missed dearly. In recent times, Zoe had passionately pursued a career in professional cycling, a testament to her fervor for the sport. While her untimely passing leaves a void in our hearts, there is solace in knowing that she departed while engaging in what brought her immense joy – cycling.</p><p>To those who knew Zoe, she embodied an old soul, wise beyond her years, and held a profound understanding of life’s priorities. Though she eventually transitioned away from the shape note community, her vibrant spirit and infectious enthusiasm remained etched in the memories of all who had the privilege of knowing her. In this difficult time, we extend our thoughts, prayers, and support to Zoe’s parents, Monika Kohler and Tom Clay, as well as her siblings Noah and Josie.</p><p>Their grief is immeasurable, and we stand united in offering our love and strength during this period of mourning. For those inclined to support Zoe’s family with medical and funeral expenses, we have provided a link in the comments section. Additionally, a link to a recent interview Zoe participated in about cycle racing is included, allowing us to celebrate her passion and achievements in the cycling world.</p><p>Zoe Clay’s light will forever shine in our hearts, and we will continue to honor her memory by cherishing the time we had with her and the impact she made on our lives. May she find eternal peace, and may her family find comfort in the love and memories shared by all who were touched by her remarkable presence.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZbDprrLsmSmnZ2kv6qty6xlnKedZMewsYyco5qxXaSvqsDUmqmyZZ6WwarCxGamn2WXp7KmutKbpqunXaO8s8DHZpqaqp%2Bhtq%2BtjJ2gnpxdnrturYyfmK2ZnGKwuq%2FLoqWgZZGYsKqwxKeraA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-did-jeremy-elbertson-do-youtuber-got-arrested.html><span>←</span><span>What Did Jeremy Elbertson Do?
