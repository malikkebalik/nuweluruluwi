Other than that, he is also the CEO of INA Ventures GmbH and co-founder of SMAP. This is no secret that Abdo is the mogul when it comes to business.</strong></p><p>But despite all that, Ramtin caught the media attention for his relationship with English sports broadcaster Kate Abdo. At the moment, Ramtin is better known as the better half of Kate.</p><p>Ramtin and Kate got married in 2010. Although there were speculations that they split up in 2016, the couple called the rumors false and untrustworthy. In contrast to the rumors, they are still together in 2023.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Kate.png><p>There are many things that people do not know about Ramtin and his life. The main factor behind this happens to be his secretive nature as well.</p><p>Will we be able to get enough information on him? Let’s find out, shall we? Before all that, let’s go through his quick facts.&nbsp;</p><h2>Quick Facts</h2><table class=mytable width=795><tbody><tr><td><strong>Full Name</strong></td><td>Ramtin Abdo</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Birth Place</strong></td><td>Berlin, Germany</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Known as&nbsp;</strong></td><td>Husband of Kate Abdo</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Religion</strong></td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Nationality</strong></td><td>German</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Father’s Name</strong></td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Mother’s Name&nbsp;</strong></td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Age</strong></td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Height</strong></td><td>6’3″/190 cm/1.90 m</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Weight</strong></td><td>80 kg/176 kg</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Build</strong></td><td>Mesomorph</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Eye Color</strong></td><td>Dark Brown</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Hair Color</strong></td><td>Black</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Profession</strong></td><td>Businessman</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Associated to</strong></td><td>Ina Ventures GmbH, SMAP</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Marital Status</strong></td><td>Married</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Wife</strong></td><td>Kate Abdo</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Children</strong></td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Net Worth</strong></td><td><strong>$20 Million</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Last Update</strong></td><td>December, 2023</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Early Life And Parental Background</h2><p>Born in Berlin, the capital of Germany, Ramtin Abdi is a successful businessman and real estate mogul. Unfortunately, there is no information on his parents and siblings available on the internet.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Capture-2.png><p>Likewise, not much light has been shed on his academic background as well. But we believe, Ramtin must have some degree in business management, considering how global his business area is.</p><p>Abdo belongs to the German nationality with a white ethnic background. His religious beliefs are unknown as of 2023.</p><h2>Age, Height, And Body Measurements</h2><p>Age is the factor that tells us how long one has lived. But for some reason, some people chose not to make it public.</p><p>And Ramtin Abdo happens to be one of them. So far, his age is still a mystery though many speculate he might be in his early 50s.&nbsp;</p><p>At the same time, his wife, Kate Abdo, was born on September 8, 1981, which makes her 42 years old.&nbsp;</p><p>Aside from being a smart businessman, Abdo is a dashing gentleman as well. He is how most women describe their ideal types: tall, dark, and handsome.</p><p>Unlike many, he is not so fond of talking about himself. Ramtin stands tall at 6’3″/190 cm/1.90 m and weighs 80 kg/176 kg.&nbsp;</p><p>Just from his few public appearances with his wife, we can see Ramtin is tall and has dark brown eyes and dark hair.</p><h2>Net Worth And Salary&nbsp;</h2><p>As we know, Ramtin Abdo is a German businessman and a real estate mogul. As per some sources, he has invested millions of dollars in real estate.&nbsp;</p><p>Likewise, Abdo also owns many companies either on his own or in partnership. Currently, the German mogul is the CEO of INA Ventures GmbH and co-founder of SMAP.&nbsp;</p><p>With all these ventures and businesses, Ramtin has collected an estimated net worth of <strong>$20 million </strong>in 2023. Since he has not publicized his income to the public, his actual earnings might vary.</p><p>The Abdo couple has not revealed their assets, such as cars, houses, and businesses. But it is no secret that the two are living a lavish life.</p><p>Meanwhile, Kate is an English sports broadcaster who has an impressive net worth of $1.5 million. As a sports journalist, the British beauty makes around $100k&nbsp;yearly.</p><p>She is a social media celebrity and is one of the most searched female sports anchors. Other than being drop-dead gorgeous, she is fluent in many languages, like French, Spanish, and German.</p><p>To this date, the anchor Kate has interviewed many famous sports personalities like <a href=#>Cristiano Ronaldo</a>&nbsp;and <a href=#>Lionel Messi</a>. Moreover, she has worked with various international media houses like CNN, Sky Sports, and FOX Station.</p><p>In all of them, Abdo has worked as a sports reporter and an analyst. Some of her career highlights include full coverage of the FIFA 2010 and FIFA 2018 World Cup tournaments held in South Africa and Russia.</p><p>Furthermore, the beautiful British reporter hosted two Ballon d’Or ceremonies consecutively in 2014 and 2015. Her resume also includes covering WEFA and Europa Championships.</p><h2>Personal Life And Wife</h2><p>Ramtin Abdo is a successful business mogul who has been in the real estate industry for many years now. Apart from the people in real estate, not many people knew about him.</p><p>But after his relationship with Kate Abdo went public, Ramtin’s search went up online.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/zsxdcvbn.png><p>The couple started dating in the year 2000, and apparently, in 2010, Ramtin tied the knot with his beautiful wife, Kate Abdo. Not to mention, they have not made any plans to have a child anytime soon.</p><p>Despite that, it is no surprise that the two have been married for a decade now.</p><h3>Ramtin Abdo Is A Faithful Husband And Man</h3><p>The celebrity husband of Kate Abdo, Ramtin, is faithful and loyal to his wife.</p><p>Being a man with all the money and looks, we are sure he gets an abundance of attention from females. But what makes him a gentleman is his faithfulness to his wife.</p><p>The German businessman isn’t linked with any other women as of 2023. He rarely makes media appearances, but if he has to, it’s with his wife.&nbsp;</p><h3>Are Ramtin And Kate Still Together Or Divorced?</h3><p>Back in 2015, it was rumored the two had parted ways. But the duo was quick to deny the false allegations and revealed how much they are enjoying their married life.</p><p>The rumor of their split first began when kate shared a post of herself with Matthew Macklin on Twitter. In the picture, kate was seen placing her hand on Matthew’s shoulder.</p><p>Later on, they were seen hugging each other and holding their hands on some other posts.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/CzogyDQXgAABCYK.jpg><p>After some time, Kate was rumored to be in a relationship with Barak Bess, as they used to share a picture on their social media handles.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2023, Kate is happily married to the German businessman Ramtin Abdo, and they recently celebrated their 12th years anniversary.&nbsp;</p><h3>Fluent In Many languages</h3><p>The English sports broadcaster is fluent in many languages, like French, German, and Spanish. She revealed that speaking multiple languages was a huge bonus in her profession.&nbsp;</p><p>Likewise, Ramtin can communicate fluently in four languages, just one more, compared to his wife, Kate Abdo. He is skilled in French, Persian, English, and his mother tongue, German.</p><p>We are sure one of the secrets behind his successful business empire is his fluency in many languages. Maybe this is also one of the reasons why he and Kate have such a strong bond.&nbsp;</p><h2>Social Media Presence</h2><p>Ramtin Abdo is not a person who enjoys media attention. Because of his secretive nature, the German businessman is not active on any social media platforms at the moment.</p><p>However, his wife is available on Instagram and Twitter.
