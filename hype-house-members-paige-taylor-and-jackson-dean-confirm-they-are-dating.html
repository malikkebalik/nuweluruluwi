In one of the clips taken from the Hype House YouTube channel, Taylor, Dean, and some other boys were seen hanging out and chatting.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Dean and Taylor were seated next to each other, and Dean slowly scooched closer and closer to Taylor until he rested his head on her shoulders.&nbsp;</p><p>In another clip, Taylor and Dean were sipping from the same drink despite many other beverages. Although these are not dead giveaways, fans of the duo seem to think otherwise.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>But it looks like they were onto something because on September 6, 2022, the duo confirmed they were in a relationship.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2>Paige Taylor and Jackson Dean Confirm Dating Rumors</h2><p>Taylor and Dean were on TikTok Live and talking about their lives as Hype House members, but they kept getting questions from fans asking if they were dating.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, Dean responded to it. “Are y’all dating,” Dean read a comment while Taylor giggled. Dean then looked over at Taylor and replied, “yup,” while Taylor waved and went, “wooo.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><strong>Paige Taylor and Jackson Dean confirm they are dating. </strong>(Source: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>The new couple addressed nothing else and only confirmed they were in a relationship.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>This clip has been reshared by tiktokinsiders on their Instagram and based on the comments that people have left, they are elated for the new couple.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>“I am happy for them. I like them more than her [Taylor] and Jacob anyway,” one user wrote regarding rumors that Taylor was also dating another Hype House member, Jacob Day. “They are so cute together. I hope they last longer and ignore the hates,” a Packson shipper commented.</p><p>But not everyone was supportive, and some even accused them of clout. Some netizens felt that the duo were only together because everyone was hyping them up.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>“So you are just saying you are together because everyone wants you to be?” questioned a user who suspected the couple.&nbsp;</p><h2>Fans Already Hounding the Couple for Details</h2><p>Naturally, fans want the details when popular TikTokers confirm their relationship, and it looks like fans have already hounded Taylor and Dean.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>After confirming they were dating, Dean went on a solo TikTok Live, where he shared that he was not ignoring the comments and did not want to talk about his new relationship “24/7.”</p><p>“I don’t want to talk about that 24/7. And people keep saying add Paige, but she’s not live. She’s busy if not I would add her. But y’all keep saying, ‘where is Paige? Add Paige.’ But the thing is, she’s doing YouTube stuff now,” said Dean.&nbsp;</p><p>He claimed&nbsp;that was why he ignored fans’ comments asking him about Taylor. The clip of his TikTok Live was uploaded by @paige.editz.1 on TikTok.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In the comment section of the clip, everyone seemed to sympathize with Dean. They iterated that people needed to give the couple their space and privacy.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKiRnrSmedOasKWnomKxosDIp55mopGYuLS7zWabnpmeY7W1ucs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./george-kolasa-net-worth-2023-career-earnings-and-achivement.html><span>←</span><span>George Kolasa Net Worth 2023 | Career Earnings And Achivement</span></a>
