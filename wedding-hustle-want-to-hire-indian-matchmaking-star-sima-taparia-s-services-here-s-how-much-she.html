You can avail her services through her website <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">here</a>. If you're wondering about the hefty price tag for the matchmaking service, then her website details out everything that's part of the package, which begins with collection of information and documents relevant to you, and registering you as the member of the matchmaking service. Then based on your lifestyle and preferences, Sima and her team will shortlist the matches. Then horoscopes are matched before approaching the families for approval of the proposals. Once both the families approve of a match, then a meeting is arranged, and a representative from Sima Taparia's matchmaking service accompanies the meeting to ensure smooth co-ordination, and finally the feedback is shared with both the families post meeting.&nbsp;</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Condé Nast Traveller India</a>, Sima explained how she works and the logic behind her pricing. She shared, "I go and meet the boy and the family, see what their home is like, where they work, where they have been to school. This helps me assess their lifestyles so I can recommend a match that is on an even keel. This is where Tinder, Bumble and Shaadi.com can't compete. I get to the bottom of things, finding out all the inside stories, the family's values and other such details you would never get from looking at a person's online profile." "I only work with high-profile clients. In India when I meet clients they usually have a working wedding budget in mind. So based on that golden number, I quote my price that I charge as a lump sum."," she added.</p><p>'Indian Matchmaking' Season 2 will be available for streaming on Netflix, following its premiere on Wednesday, August 10, 2022.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRooZ6ZtqK6jKaYrZuYoq6stc2gZKedpJu5qsSMoaawZZ2qsKl50qKkmmWklr2ivsiaZJygkae0pnmXaWdpZZmjv26AjKWYpKBdqLKzwsicnKxlop6wqQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./taylor-hill-bio-wiki.html><span>←</span><span>Taylor Hill Bio (Wiki)</span></a>
