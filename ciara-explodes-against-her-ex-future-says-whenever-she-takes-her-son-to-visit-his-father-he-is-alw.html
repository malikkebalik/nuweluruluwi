Their son’s name is Future Zahir Wilburn.</p><p>But Ciara just lost her cool at Future’s behavior. As he has missed meeting his son 37% of the scheduled time. Whenever she takes the child to his father, he is every time busy with something or the other and the little boy spends time with grandma or great-grandma instead of his dad. So, Ciara has complained in court to the judge about Future skipping his schedule to meet his son.</p><p>She has also raised the emotional breakdowns and health issues Future Zahir has because of traveling. So she wants a schedule where Future can make out his time and medication for their son.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Relationship_between_Ciara_and_Future></span><span>Relationship between Ciara and Future</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The couple met for the first time while working together in the studio maybe in 2011/2012. In 2012, Future remixed Ciara’s song&nbsp;Sorry&nbsp;and in 2013, he was seen in her fifth album songs, “Where You Go” and the “Body Party”. In an interview in 2013, when she was asked about the future, she replied,</p><p>“He is an amazing guy. He is really a gentleman and I don’t want to say too much, and then he’s like, ‘Babe, you’re saying a whole lot,’ but he really is just an amazing man. It’s like when we were working on the personal side of things, I really saw an amazing person and the way that he approached me since day one is just the way a man is supposed to be from my perspective.”</p><p>She added,</p><p>“It just really organically happened that way. I didn’t expect anything to come from us working together. I didn’t even know what to expect from going into the studio with him and then we began to meet each other and everything just began to flow. He is really cool—like he is my friend too. So I felt something really unique from the beginning and then it just organically went this way.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/ciara-and-future-and-their-son.jpg><p>The couple was so much in love that they were head over heels.
