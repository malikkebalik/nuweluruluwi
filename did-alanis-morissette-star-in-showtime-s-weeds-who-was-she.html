Alanis Morissette is not only an acclaimed singer but is also an excellent actress. She has worked on many projects, from theaters and TV series to films and documentaries.&nbsp;
Arguably, one of the best projects Morissette has worked on is Weeds. The show is a dark comedy-drama that aired from&nbsp;August 8, 2005, to September 16, 2012, on Showtime.&nbsp; 
As the name of the show suggests, Weeds revolves around a single mother, Nancy Botwin (Mary-Louise Parker), who sells marijuana to support her children after the death of her husband."><meta name=author content="Jenniffer Sheldon"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

It was made after the cliffhanger season four finale, which&nbsp;showed&nbsp;Botwin's pregnancy.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>She got pregnant by Esteban (Demian Bichir), the mayor of Tijuana. Now that Botwin was pregnant, she needed an&nbsp;obstetrician.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Therefore, Morissette signed on to that role. It was reported that she would guest star as&nbsp;Dr. Kitson for at least seven episodes in the fifth season.&nbsp;</p><p>Alongside being a doctor for Botwin, Morissette's character would also be a love interest for Andy (Justin Kirk), Botwin's brother-in-law.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">IGN reported</a>&nbsp;the singer was the second biggest casting for Weeds. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p></p><p><strong id=docs-internal-guid-310fd43f-7fff-c5eb-42f3-38f5718eeb6c>Alanis Morissette on Alter Ego.

She watched it at the back of her bus while going through "a cleanse."</p><p>She confessed that since she was changing her lifestyle through cleansing,&nbsp;the show helped her go through it. As a result, she was drawn into the show and loved it.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p></p><p><strong id=docs-internal-guid-78580c8b-7fff-fc1d-c2ad-94a412e49207>Alanis Morissette in a recording studio.

She did the same with Curb Your Enthusiasm and Sex in the City.&nbsp;</p><p>Coming back to Weeds, Morissette said that she was oriented on the spot on the set. Therefore, there was a gynecologist who guided her about how things work.&nbsp;</p><p>The real-life doctor taught her how to be a fake one on-screen from the start since the singer's first scene was Botwin's gynecological exam. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-176 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>It&nbsp;was awkward since she had never done it before.&nbsp;However, with the help of the gynecologist, Morissette performed phenomenally.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJmclruqv4ympquho6iytcDEZq6enZSoe6nAzKU%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./alexandra-daddario-is-heating-up-instagram-skinny-dips-on-a-vacation.html><span>←</span><span>Alexandra Daddario Is Heating Up Instagram!
