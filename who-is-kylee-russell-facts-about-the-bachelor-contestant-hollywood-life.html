In the meantime, learn more about Kylee with five facts below!</p><h2>1. Kylee Is A Registered Nurse</h2><p id=content-paragraph-6>Kylee works as a postpartum nurse in Charlotte, North Carolina. She became a Registered Nurse in December 2021, according to an <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> post. “Ya girl did it!!!” she wrote. “So thankful to my family and friends who supported me throughout this incredibly hard journey. When I decided to go back and get a second degree, I was extremely nervous, but knew this was where God was leading me. These past two years have been harder than I could’ve ever imagined, but so worthwhile. I am excited to announce that I have accepted a position on the Mother Baby Postpartum unit at Atrium Health.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Before becoming a nurse, Kylee received her Bachelor’s Degree in Marketing from Wingate University in 2019. She worked as a social media intern at a bridal shop in North Carolina, according to her <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>LinkedIn</a>.</p><h2>2. Kylee Was An NBA Dancer</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Kylee-Russell-5-things-bachelor-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-8>Kylee was selected to be a member of the Charlotte Hornets dance team, the Honey Bees, three times. In July 2022, she revealed on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> that she was chosen for her third time on the team. “I just simply don’t feel deserving of this,” Kylee wrote. “Year 3…wow time really does fly when you’re living your best life. I’ve said it a million times, but I’ll say it again — becoming a Honey Bee has been one of the best things to ever happen to me. I finally felt like I found my place and there is nowhere else I’d rather me. Thankful for an organization that has given me the best two years of my life and affording me the opportunity to experience it all again.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>However, Kylee is not listed on the current roster on the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Honey Bee’s website</a>. She filmed&nbsp;The Bachelor in the fall of 2022, which is the start of the NBA basketball season, so it appears she had to give up her spot on the team in hopes of finding love!</p><h2>3. Kylee Has Competed In Pageants</h2><p id=content-paragraph-10>In addition to school, work and dancing, Kylee has also been on the pageant circuit. In a Jan. 2022 <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> post, she revealed that she was registering for Miss North Carolina after being named Miss Cornelius. However, she was not selected as Miss North Carolina, and the honor went to&nbsp;<strong>Morgan Romano</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Kylee-Russell-5-things-bachelor-embed2.jpg><h2>4. Kylee Is Ready For Kids</h2><p id=content-paragraph-11>As a postpartum nurse, Kylee is around kids a lot, and she wants a baby of her own “ASAP,” according to her <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>ABC bio</a>. “She may only be 6, but Kylee is ready to live the soccer mom life, so hopefully Zach is on the same page!” her bio reads.</p><h2>5. Kylee Grew Up Without Her Biological Father</h2><p id=content-paragraph-12>In an interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>BachelorNation.com</a>, Kylee opened up about what she hopes to share with Zach as this season continues. “I grew up not knowing my biological father and a lot has stemmed from that for me,” she admitted. “Everything I’ve been through shaped me to become the person I am today. I’ve been through a lot of struggles to get to where I am currently.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9ahpmaho2K4urjEnmSrraOosq24jK2fnmWSlrCpscuoqWZtYGeGdX%2BPaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tragic-loss-edward-barnes-obituary-gattman-mississippi-mourns-loss-of-beloved-community-pillar-r.html><span>←</span><span>Tragic Loss!
