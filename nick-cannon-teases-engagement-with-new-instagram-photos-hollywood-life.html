ET): </strong>After sparking engagement rumors via a post to Instagram meant to promote his new song, “Eyes Closed”, Nick Cannon has confirmed that he did not actually get engaged. “I love the idea of marriage, especially the ceremony, the proposing, the idea of just falling in love,” he said on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Entertainment Tonight</a> as he co-hosted the show with <strong>Nischelle Turner </strong>from Baha Mar in the Bahamas. “Who cares what the rest of the world thinks? You never know.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>He continued, “I’m doing what the world wants me to do, I’m dropping an amazing music video.” Describing his new tune, he said it’s about “just going in with your eyes closed and being a hopeless romantic.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4><strong>(ORIGINAL STORY)&nbsp;</strong>“I said I would never do it again but…Finally doing what the world wants me to do…” <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Nick Cannon</a> </strong>captioned the photos he posted to Instagram on July 14. In the first pic, Nick, 41, embraces a mystery woman as city lights shine in the background (TMZ claims it’s <strong>Brie Tiesi, </strong>the ex-wife of <strong>Johnny Manziel </strong>who’s <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>pregnant with Nick’s eighth child</a>.) In the second slide in the post, Nick holds a diamond engagement ring in a jewelry box.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>While the photos’ professional look made it seem like Nick hired someone to capture the moment, others thought they were stills from an upcoming project of his. “What movie is this for?” asked one, unconvinced that this proposal was legit. “It’s a movie or something of sort either way n—- u acting,” wrote another. “Is this a music video?” asked another. “This gotta be a music video cuz IKYFL,” commented <strong>Ernest Dukes</strong>. “Wait, which one this?” asked another, unable to recognize the woman in the picture. <strong>HollywoodLife </strong>reached out to Nick’s camp for clarification on the piece and will update the post with any additional info.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Nick has a wide range of potential brides. Along with Bre, Nick is reportedly expecting more kids to arrive this year. Nick is <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>reportedly</a> the father of model&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Abby De La Rosa’s</a> </strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>upcoming baby</a>. The model announced her pregnancy earlier in June, and reports painted Nick as the father. Abby and Nick already share twins, <strong>Zillion&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>Zion, </strong>who celebrated their <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>first birthday</a> in June.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/nick-cannon-reveals-hes-engaged-ss-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-9>During a July appearance on&nbsp;Angela Yee’s Lip Service podcast, Nick said that “the stork is on the way” and was coy about the number of kids he’ll have once the year’s over. “That would take all the fun out of it if I just gave you a number right now,” he said, per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Entertainment Tonight</a>. “You would be safe to bet on three [more children] in 2022.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>Nick’s “proposal” comes on the heels of him saying that he’ll “<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>never have a love</a>” like the one he had with his ex-wife, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Mariah Carey</strong></a>. “It was literally like a fairytale with Mariah, so I would rather it just be that way, and I appreciate that fantasy because if I try to go back and it wasn’t the same, I’d be like, ‘Damn, I messed it up,'” he said on The Hottee Talk Show Podcast. “I guess because I’m a true romantic, I’m a true believer in love, and I allow the capsules of love to be where they lie. I’m not a timeline dude. I will never have a love like I did with Mariah.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH14e5BuZqehk6B6pK3Np6anZaSarrSx0macp5%2BRnLKusc2tZKmgn6m8tHs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./klailea-bennett.html><span>←</span><span>Klailea Bennett</span></a>
