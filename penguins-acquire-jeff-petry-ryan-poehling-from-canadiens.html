If the Marino deal felt like setting up something bigger, this trade feels like a sort of old fashioned hockey deal.</p><p>The Penguins have liked Petry for a while, and despite his age and contract (actually, those make him seem like a fit for Pittsburgh) he should become a second-pairing anchor on the back end. Then again, so seemingly would have been Matheson.</p><p>So this is probably the case of the Penguins simply liking Perry's game better than Matheson’s for what they want to be — tougher to play against. Poehling feels like a throw-in.</p><p>And speaking of feels, this deal feels like just another move that will be part of a bigger picture that hasn't emerged yet. The Penguins still have too many defensemen on one-way contracts, and they're still at least a couple forwards shy of what they'd like to have coming into camp.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><h2>Why did the Canadiens make this move?</h2><p>Arpon Basu, Canadiens senior columnist: Canadiens GM Kent Hughes made it clear he would not trade Jeff Petry unless his team came out of it improved.</p><p>Mike Matheson was one of his clients before Hughes took the job with the Canadiens, so he knows him well and is banking on the fact that adding Matheson to his blue line group makes it better. He is 28, so younger than Petry, and fills a hole left on the left side by trading Alexander Romanov to the New York Islanders at the draft. It is a swing on a player he knows well, but the result is the Canadiens gained some financial flexibility while bringing in a player they believe in.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqutbTLnquim16YvK57km1sa29kZ3xzfJFrZmlvX2aDcLzEp56uoZ6oeqKv0K6gq51dn7KnsoypnK2qqWK%2Fuq3NZqeonZihtq%2BzjJ%2BpqKVdmK6vrcOinKerXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./maria-caroline-ingraham-was-adopted-by-laura-ingraham.html><span>←</span><span>Maria Caroline Ingraham | Was adopted by Laura Ingraham</span></a>
