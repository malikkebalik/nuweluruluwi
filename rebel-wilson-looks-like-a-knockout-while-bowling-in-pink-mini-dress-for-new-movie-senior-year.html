The Australian actress was in full character on-set of her new film Senior Year in her latest Instagram photo, posted on Wednesday, June 9, wearing a fuzzy, light pink mini dress with an embroidered red heart across the chest. She added a matching light pink sweater and red strapped heels to finish off the mid-90’s inspired look.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Rebel simply captioned the post with pink heart emojis as she shouted out the movie’s stylist for “the sweetest costumes,” alongside tags for her glam squad. In the upcoming comedy, Bogan Pride&nbsp;plays a high school cheerleader who was in a coma for 20 years. After waking up, she realizes she not only missed out on her milestone final year — but didn’t get to be prom queen!</p><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100% rel=nofollow>View this post on Instagram<p id=content-paragraph-4></p></a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>A post shared by Rebel Wilson (@rebelwilson)</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-5></p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Hair and makeup are key to bringing any character to life, but there’s no denying that Rebel is looking like an absolute bombshell! The actress, who decided to make 2020 her “year of health,” has been staying fit and motivated ever since beginning her fitness journey. Last November, Rebel shared with her Instagram followers that she had <a style="font-family:-apple-system,BlinkMacSystemFont,segoe ui,Roboto,Oxygen-Sans,Ubuntu,Cantarell,helvetica neue,sans-serif" href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>met her targeted goal weight, with just one month to spare before the new year.</a> Through 2021, Rebel has continued to strive for a healthy lifestyle, regularly sharing workout routines and her healthy living tips with fans.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/rebel-wilson-weight-loss-backgrid-embed.jpg alt="Rebel Wilson" width=620 height=930 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p id=content-paragraph-8>The Pitch Perfect star made it clear that her choice to lose weight had nothing to do with vanity, but rather the choice to live a healthier lifestyle on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Drew Berrymore Show</a> last year. “I love my curves and stuff. I don’t think I’ll ever go too skinny, but I feel so much healthier,” she shared, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>crediting help from fitness trainer, Jono Castano</a>, and a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>good high-protein diet plan </a>to her success.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>“I think what I really suffered from was emotional eating and dealing with the stress of becoming famous internationally. There is a lot of stress that comes with it, and I guess my way of dealing with it was just eating donuts,” she added. With her positive outlook and strong dedication, Rebel will certainly continue to look great on the inside and out, and inspire her fans to be their best self too.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWphZH13e49yZqudkpq5bsPIpaqopl2itq%2B1jJ2pnqujYry2wMWiq2arlaO2sL6Mspyaql8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mary-hart-wiki-bio-married-husband-wedding-young-son-net-worth-2017.html><span>←</span><span>Mary Hart Wiki Bio Married Husband Wedding Young Son Net Worth 2017!</span></a>
