You have kids and they do all the hard work, they take out the trash and clean up the dog poop, do the dishes.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Their parents’ lessons seem to have paid off in the long run. Cameron, of course, found success as an A-list actress, while Chimene made a name for herself as a certified fitness instructor and as a realtor. She’s also the mother of four children, who have Cameron in their life as a loving aunt.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Cameron and Chimene appear to have a special bond. Over the years, Chimene has posted lots of Instagram photos of herself and her sister enjoying each other’s company.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">So, who is Chimene Diaz?

I had amazing parents, they were awesome.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Cameron recalled during the same interview that they would regularly go on family road trips to Sequoia National Park. “We used to go camping, because we couldn’t really afford to go on vacations,” she said. “We would set up a tent, go fishing and barbecue over the fire.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">They also frequently visited their grandmother, who had livestock and made her own clothes.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-shes-a-mother-of-four></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>She’s a mother of four</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In her <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Instagram bio</a>, Chimene describes herself as a “Crazy mother of 4.” She has three daughters, Emmi, Channing and Chloe, as well as a son, Emilio. In addition to the human members of the family, she’s also mother to a cat named Pirate, a dog named Luna and a turtle named Joe.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Chimene loves showing off her kids online. She often shares photos of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Channing playing volleyball</a>, and when Emilio joined the Navy in 2018, Chimene expressed her pride in a post. “Emilio is now serving our country!” she captioned a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>photo</a> of herself and her son smiling. “GO NAVY! 🇺🇸💗so proud of my boy! 💗🇺🇸.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In a June 2022 post, Chimene reflected on being a single mom. She shared a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>photo of Channing’s journal</a> and wrote, “I want to say cheers to all the single moms out there! I feel you and know what challenges this day brings.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“You all are Rock Stars!” she continued. “This day is for us as much as it’s for those amazing dads that show up and put effort into life.

In October 2021, they joined Ferguson Realty in Seal Beach, California, per Cameron’s sister’s <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Instagram</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Chimene and Rhonda said on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Realtor.com</a>, “Our work experience has gained us the skills that made our real estate business a success; Hard work, integrity, determination, negotiation, communication, and most importantly, the commitment to put the needs and interests of others as our top priority.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The realtor also has a passion for fitness. In November 2017, Chimene shared a photo of her official group fitness instructor certification on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Instagram</a>. “It’s official!!!” she wrote. “Sign Sealed and Delivered!

I don’t think it’s a compromise not to. I think it’s just a different choice.” (She later became a mother herself, welcoming <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>her daughter Raddix</a> in December 2019.)</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-chimene-loves-hanging-out-with-cameron-and-supporting-her></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Chimene loves hanging out with Cameron and supporting her</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Cameron Diaz and Chimene Diaz at the 'There's Something About Mary Premiere' in 1998.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Bei/Shutterstock</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">There are several photos of Cameron and Chimene smiling together on Chimene’s Instagram.
