Yet, with people finally finishing the new game, people might be wondering who <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://stylecaster.com/entertainment/tv-movies/1603763/spider-man-across-the-spider-verse-post-credit-scenes/ rel="noreferrer noopener">Cindy Moon is in Spider-Man 2.</a></p><p>Spider-Man 2 takes place ten months after the events of Spider-Man: Miles Morales. The game follows both Peter Parker and Miles Morales who don the Spider-Man mantle and the events that happen right after the events of the first video game.</p><p>Insomniac Games Senior Creative Director&nbsp;Bryan Intihar told <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://www.marvel.com/articles/games/marvels-spider-man-2-worthy-two-spider-men-bryan-intihar-interview rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Marvel</a> about the strategy of playing as the two Spider-Men in the game. “I think there’s a reason why it’s called&nbsp;Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, because we wanted to have a game featuring both Peter and Miles,” he explained. “I think that was the goal; it was, ‘We want to tell an epic story of two Spider-Men,’ and I feel like we’ve done that… We’ve delivered that.”</p><p>“I think what we wanted is we wanted to <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://stylecaster.com/entertainment/culture/1607856/what-canon-event/ rel="noreferrer noopener">have a story</a> [with] adversaries that are worthy of requiring two Spider-Men to save the day, hence bringing in this guy [Tony Todd] and seeing Venom,” he continued. “And then also, looking at our cast of&nbsp;Kraven&nbsp;and&nbsp;Lizard&nbsp;and others, they’re really challenging our heroes in ways that they’ve never been challenged before, whether it’s physically, psychologically.”</p><p>Unlike the first game, the game stretches beyond the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://stylecaster.com/gallery/spider-man-across-the-spider-verse-cast/>Manhattan</a> burough of New York City and opens up a new world of opportunities for fans of the video game.”Then you just look at the scale of the game with doubling the size of the city with Queens and Brooklyn, adding new traversal abilities with the Web Wings, and then just the whole role that the symbiote plays in both gameplay and the story,” Intihar added. “We knew when we said, ‘It’s gonna be called&nbsp;Marvel’s Spider-Man 2,’ we had to earn that title, and I think that was the journey we wanted to go on.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screen-Shot-2023-10-23-at-3.13.46-PM.png><p>Spider-Man 2</p><p>Actor Nadji Jeter talked about his character’s more mature side compared to the first game.”Miles is definitely growing up. So, we see him go through the changes from a young high school kid, going through the puberty changes and just through the manhood changes and then now becoming his own. He’s definitely owning a lot more of what he’s become,” he said. “So, just with Brooklyn being involved and just with everything in Marvel’s New York, it kind of makes him his own, just through the ruggedness, the fast-paced moving, just the villains. Everybody that’s in Marvel’s New York sums up Miles’ behavior as he’s growing into this equal to Peter.”</p><p>Through Miles, we’re introduced to this new character briefly during the end credits scene. So who is Cindy Moon?

Their neighbor Hailey arrives and Rio insists that she look over Miles’ essay in his room. They go over to his room and share a kiss, but are interrupted by a knock on the door. Rio’s boyfriend Albert Moon introduces himself and his daughter Cindy, who waves back at them, and the scene cuts to black.</p><p>If you’re not familiar with Cindy Moon, she was introduced in 2014 in The Amazing Spider-Man #1 where she was bitten by the same spider as Peter Parker. She has the same abilities as Peter, except for the fact that she has organic webbing when Peter has to make his own web shooters. She goes by the name Silk and is imperative to the Great Web, the thing that connects all Spider-beings in the comics. Since we only see the back of her head for a split second in the end-credits scene, it’s not known how big of a role she will have for future Spider-Man installments. But with the pattern that the developers have, she might be the third Spider-person for the third one, and adding another Spidey to the mix is a win for any fan.</p><p>Our mission at StyleCaster is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.
