She is a businesswoman and former backup singer, best known for working with talents like <a href=#>Ike Turner</a>, The Beatles, Rolling Stones, <a href=#>Stevie Wonder</a> and many more. She’s also the owner of restaurant Sweety Pie’s and star of the reality television show “Welcome to Sweety Pie’s”. Her business has helped her immensely in building her net worth.</p><p>How rich is Robbie Montgomery? Sources estimate that her net worth is at $10 million as of early 2016, and most of this can be traced back to her extensive career in the music industry. Currently, most of her wealth comes from her restaurant and the television show that earns her consistent revenue.</p><h3>Robbie Montgomery Net Worth $10 Million</h3><p>Robbie passion for music started at an early age, while attending Curtis Elementary School in St. Louis. She participated in many school talent shows and sang in the school choir. Later, she attended Pruitt High School and after graduating, went on to pursue a career in music. Montgomery became part of the group called the Chordrettes, who then went through a few name changes, becoming the Rhythemettes and eventually the Ardrettes. Then in 1959 Robbie found an opportunity to sing as a background singer for the <a href=#>Ike</a> and <a href=#>Tina Turner</a> song Fool in Love. She became a background singer for <a href=#>Ike</a> and part of the group called the Ikettes. After spending seven years as an Ikette, she left the group to sing background for The Beatles. In 1971, she became a Nighttripper, a group of background singers for Dr. John. During this period she had also become a background singer for artists like The Supremes, <a href=#>James Brown</a>, Pink Floyd, <a href=#>Elton John</a>, and many more. Robbie also started to do commercial jingles, and handled two groups named: Robbie Special Kinds and Robbie’s Dangerous Curves. Around a year after doing this kind of work, her lung collapsed and she was diagnosed with asthma which made her decide to quit singing.</p><p>She started dialyses and it took a toll on the money she had acquired. She eventually decided on starting a business by opening a restaurant, and in 1998 she opened Sweetie Pie’s Restaurant, focusing on family soul food recipes. The restaurant became a hit and increased Robbie’s net worth significantly. It became the number one soul food restaurant in St. Louis, Missouri and has opened in three more locations. The <a href=#>Oprah Winfrey</a> network then decided to air a reality TV show that focused on how Robbie handles the business, along with her son and business partner <a href=#>Tim Norman</a>.</p><p>Not much is known about Robbie Montgomery’s personal life. Tim is her second son – her first son was found dead sometime after Robbie had quit singing. She’s mentioned her son as an inspiration to opening her restaurant. Even in her 70s, Robbie has never married – her sons fathers are unknown publicly – but still believes that she can find romance and love at her age. She currently lives in St. Louis and handles the restaurant business.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<h3>Known for movies</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/networthpost.org/wp-content/themes/net-worth/images/celebrity_net_worth.png><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlanEsL7Toaeoq6RjvLOzjqumm5qZmnquu82tnqillafGbrrErWSwp6KptXA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./pregnant-seattle-mom-eina-kwon-killed-in-tesla-in-daylight-shooting.html><span>←</span><span>Pregnant Seattle mom Eina Kwon killed in Tesla in daylight shooting</span></a>
