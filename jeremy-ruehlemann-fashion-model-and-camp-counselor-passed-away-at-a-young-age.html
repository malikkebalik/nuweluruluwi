However, after just four years of studying at the university he made the life-changing decision to drop out and pursue a career in modeling. This choice was seen as extremely brave by many people due to the uncertainty of what was ahead. Nonetheless, Jeremy worked hard and soon became a highly successful model appearing on magazine covers such as Vogue, GQ, Harper‚Äôs Bazaar and Elle. He also went on to work with many big fashion names like Gucci, Prada and Versace. Despite his fame and success, Jeremy never forgot about his passion for psychology and even used his platform to bring attention to issues concerning mental health awareness.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-909 data-method=placement-service></span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/rajasdentalcollege.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/74682710_1361526840687987_313085652541374464_n.webp><p><strong>Read this also: <a href=#>Simon Dunn, Former Australian Bobsledder and Rugby player Dies at Age of 35</a></strong></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-112 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Jeremy_Ruehlemann_Cause_of_Death></span>Jeremy Ruehlemann Cause of Death? <span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Jeremy was known not just for his success in the fashion world, but also as a passionate camp counselor dedicated to helping children.
