About her childhood, she stated that “it’s almost embarrassing how well-behaved I was, which is probably why I do things like spit water on myself on stage as an adult”.&nbsp;She attended&nbsp;Oberlin College&nbsp;before transferring to&nbsp;New York University’s&nbsp;Tisch School of the Arts.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2>Karen O Net Worth</h2><p><b>&nbsp;O</b>&nbsp;is an American musician who has a&nbsp;net worth of $8 million dollars.

The duo will support their recent album with a single live show on Friday, September 6th, at Los Angeles’ Theatre at Ace Hotel.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Fans can register for tickets to the upcoming Los Angeles show from now until 10:00 p.m. PT tomorrow, July 23rd. Tickets will be allocated on Friday, July 26th. While the pair’s fall performance marks their lone appearance together for&nbsp;Lux Prima, O and Mouse have found other ways to celebrate their landmark collaboration.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Following the LP’s release back in March, O and Danger Mouse hosted a groundbreaking&nbsp;art installation&nbsp;and run of sold-out listening parties at Los Angeles’ Marciano Art Foundation. They also tapped Spike Jonze to direct their&nbsp;non-traditional appearance&nbsp;on&nbsp;The Late Show with Stephen Colbert&nbsp;in the spring.</p><h2>Karen O Yeah Yeah Yeahs</h2><p>Yeah Yeah Yeahs is an American indie rock band formed in New York City in 2000. The group is composed of vocalist and pianist&nbsp; O, guitarist and keyboardist Nick Zinner, and drummer Brian Chase. They are complemented in live performances by second guitarist David Pajo, who joined as a touring member in 2009 and replaced Imaad Wasif who had previously held this role.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>The band has recorded four studio albums; the first, Fever to Tell, was released in 2003. The second, Show Your Bones, was released in 2006 and was named the second-best album of the year by NME. Their third studio album, It’s Blitz!, was released in March 2009. All three albums earned the band Grammy nominations for Best Alternative Music Album. Their fourth album, Mosquito, was released on April 2013.</p><h2>Karen O Ko At Home</h2><p>KO at Home is a demo CD by Karen that was leaked onto the Internet in mid-December 2006. Karen recorded 14 songs in her own home several years before they were unearthed in late 2006. The demo (46 minutes and 22 seconds) mostly consists of acoustic songs, with several different tracks on each song, all played by Karen. She burned those songs onto a CD-R, created a handwritten cover (including a photo of her with Janet Weiss of Sleater-Kinney and an Oscar Wilde quote) and gave it as a gift to TV on the Radio’s guitarist and music producer, Dave Sitek.</p><p>After several years, Dave moved out of his apartment, leaving behind several items including two briefcases. One of these briefcases contained the KO at Home demo CD. An anonymous man (known only as “Mike”) found the CD and decided to keep it and give it to a friend as a gift. Before he gave it away, he converted the CD to MP3s on his computer. Soon after, he decided to post them on the Internet, citing that he found the tracks to be “interesting” and that he “thought other fans might appreciate them.”</p><h2>Karen O The Moon Song Lyrics</h2><p>I’m lying on the moon<br>My dear, I’ll be there soon<br>It’s a quiet and starry place<br>Time’s we’re swallowed up<br>In space we’re here a million miles away</p><p>There’s things I wish I knew<br>There’s no thing I’d keep from you<br>It’s a dark and shiny place<br>But with you my dear<br>I’m safe and we’re a million miles away</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>We’re lying on the moon<br>It’s a perfect afternoon<br>Your shadow follows me all day<br>Making sure that I’m<br>Okay and we’re a million miles away</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><h2>Karen O Band</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Yeah Yeah Yeahs is an American indie rock band formed in New York City in 2000. The group is composed of vocalist and pianist Karen , guitarist and keyboardist Nick Zinner, and drummer Brian Chase. They are complemented in live performances by second guitarist David Pajo, who joined as a touring member in 2009 and replaced Imaad Wasif who had previously held this role. According to an interview that aired during the ABC network’s Live from Central Park SummerStage series, the band’s name was taken from modern New York City vernacular.</p><h2>Karen O Leather Jacket</h2><p>Designed by Karen O’s frequent collaborator and costume designer&nbsp;Christian Joy, the ensemble melded all of Karen’s best&nbsp;Fever to Tell–era onstage looks. “I decided to base it off the song ‘Black Tongue’ because it’s one of my favorite songs as well as a fan favorite,” Joy says.</p><p>Karen specifically asked Joy for a trenchcoat, and Joy commissioned customizing expert Luke Good of Bad Luck Embroidery to embroider the black tongue along with all of the coat’s other exquisite details. Joy spray-painted brocade KOs and studs all over, creating a design similar to one that she made for Karen during her last record cycle.</p><p>When Karen O saw the jacket’s matching pants for the first time, which are emblazoned in red with the words&nbsp;scream&nbsp;and&nbsp;shake&nbsp;along the sides, she responded: “Nothing says I’m back like my name on my butt!”</p><p>Christian Joy was the visionary behind all of Karen O’s costumes. That’s something to remember—the impact of all these bands on the fashion world was felt fairly quickly. Suddenly, everyone wanted to dress up. The Strokes looked so cool, you wanted to look cool. The vintage leather jacket and the Converse became the look. By the time you got the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, I remember, right away, writing pieces about Karen O’s influence on fashion. They were fairly instantaneous game-changers.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span><h2>Karen O Outfits |&nbsp;Karen&nbsp; Fashion</h2><p>O&nbsp;style can’t be defined.
