He has just one since Week 7 (21.1) and just one other over 16.3 points (18.2). The Broncos haven’t let a quarterback top 17.3 points since Week 4.</li></ul><p><strong>Bears at Browns, 1 p.m.</strong></p><p><img width=587 height=589 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2023/12/13082620/CHI15.jpg alt sizes="(max-width: 587px) 100vw, 587px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><ul><li>The Lions are the only team (twice) since Week 3 to rush for over 97 yards against the Bears with five teams held to 54 or fewer rushing yards.</li><li>Amari Cooper, Elijah Moore and David Njoku account for 69.9% of Joe Flacco’s targets in his two starts, and they each have 108+ receiving yards combined over those two games.</li><li>D’Onta Foreman had 72.2 RBTouch% last week with all three running backs active, which was actually his second-highest mark this year.</li></ul><p><strong>Buccaneers at Packers, 1 p.m.</strong></p><p><img width=587 height=589 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2023/12/13082628/TB15.jpg alt sizes="(max-width: 587px) 100vw, 587px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><ul><li>Chris Godwin is the only wideout with just one touchdown and 51+ receptions or 541+ receiving yards.</li><li>When Christian Watson is out, Romeo Doubs and Jayden Reed are tied with 20.9 TmTGT% with Dontayvion Wicks third at 14.4%. Reed has 62.9 points and Doubs 53.5.</li><li>Drake London was the 10th wideout to have 100+ receiving yards against the Buccaneers this year — the Seahawks are second with eight allowed.</li></ul><p><strong>Texans at Titans, 1 p.m.</strong></p><p><img width=587 height=589 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2023/12/13082635/HOU15.jpg alt sizes="(max-width: 587px) 100vw, 587px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><ul><li>Obviously, no C.J.

The Texans have kept the last four backfields (ARI, JAX, DEN, NYJ) from scoring a rushing touchdown.</li><li>For the year, only Garrett Wilson (48.3), Davante Adams (46.3), A.J.
