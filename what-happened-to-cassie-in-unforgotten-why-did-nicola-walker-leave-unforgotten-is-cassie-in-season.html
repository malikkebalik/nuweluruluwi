Is Cassie in Season</h1></header><section class=post-content><h2 id=unforgotten_ class=smooth-goto>Unforgotten</h2><p>Unforgotten is a British crime drama television series that follows a team of London detectives as they solve cold cases of disappearance and murder. Each series consists of six episodes, with Series 1 to 4 airing in the UK in 2015, 2017, 2018, and 2021. A fifth series was announced on 30 March 2021, with Sinéad Keenan replacing Nicola Walker as DCI Jess James alongside Sanjeev Bhaskar. Each series deals with a new case, introducing seemingly unconnected characters who are gradually revealed to have some relationship with the victim. The emotional ramifications of the crime on the lives of those affected are also explored. Unforgotten has received critical acclaim, with Tom Courtenay and Mark Bonnar winning BAFTA TV Awards for their roles in the first and second series, respectively.</p><h2 id=what_happened_to_cassie_in_unforgotten class=smooth-goto>What Happened To Cassie In Unforgotten?</h2><p>The fifth season of Unforgotten introduces DCI Jess James, played by Sinéad Keenan, who takes over the main investigator role from Nicola Walker, who starred in the previous four seasons as DCI Cassie Stuart. Walker’s Cassie dies from brain injuries sustained in a tragic car accident in the season 4 finale. The new season promises tensions aplenty between Jess and Sanjeev Bhaskar’s Sunny, with the pair being at “loggerheads” with one another. Speaking to Radio Times magazine, Walker stated that her exit from the series was a joint decision between her and Chris Lang, the creator of Unforgotten. Lang had always planned for Cassie’s story to be finite, putting her through a story arc that would damage her emotionally, and having her keep coming back would make her seem like a superhero.</p><h2 id=why_did_nicola_walker_leave_unforgotten class=smooth-goto>Why Did Nicola Walker Leave Unforgotten?</h2><p>Nicola Walker left Unforgotten because Chris Lang, the creator of the show, and Walker had planned for Cassie’s story to be finite. Cassie died from brain injuries sustained in a car accident in the season 4 finale. Speaking about her recent role in BBC One’s Marriage, Walker said that she and Lang thought Cassie’s exit was a fantastic, impactful story. Walker expressed some regret about the timing of Cassie’s exit, given the onset of COVID-19, which made people feel sad. She also wanted to clarify that she did not walk away from the show, nor was she asked to leave. There is no prospect of a Cassie Stewart return in the new fifth season. DCI Jess James takes over the lead investigator role, investigating the discovery of human remains in a newly-renovated period property in Hammersmith, London. Chris Lang describes Jess as being in a very different place than Cassie, with a lot of energy, and very different to Cassie. The relationship between her and Sunny will be very different.</p><h2 id=how_did_cassie_die_in_unforgotten class=smooth-goto>How Did Cassie Die In Unforgotten?</h2><p>In Unforgotten series four, DCI Cassie Stuart struggled to balance her job and personal life, including her father’s early onset dementia and his decision to change his will. In the penultimate episode, Cassie was hit by a car and did not survive, shocking fans. Meanwhile, the crime plot revolved around the discovery of a headless and handless body in a freezer, which was identified as missing person Matthew Walsh from 30 years ago. Walsh’s mummified head and hands were later found, and it was determined that a fountain pen was the cause of death. The pen was traced to Dean Barton, who admitted to killing Walsh as revenge for his brother’s murder by Walsh a year earlier.</p><h2 id=is_cassie_in_season_5_of_unforgotten class=smooth-goto>Is Cassie in Season 5 of Unforgotten?</h2><p>ITV’s crime-drama series Unforgotten has introduced Sinead Keenan as DCI Jessica James, taking over the position previously held by Nicola Walker’s DCI Cassie Stuart who left the show following the fourth season. Keenan will play the superior of Sanjeev Bhaskar’s character DI Sunil ‘Sunny’ Khan. The actor, originally from Dublin, is recognized for her roles in TV series including Little Boy Blue, Being Human, Three Families, and Showtrial.Last year, it was announced that Sinéad Keenan would take on the lead role for the fifth season of the detective drama Unforgotten, which was filmed in March. Previously, Nicola Walker had starred as DCI Cassie Stuart alongside Sanjeev Bhaska’s award-winning performance as DS Sunil Kahn in the first four seasons of the show. Although Unforgotten has been on air since 2015, the cast change had been planned since the third season, with producers believing that Cassie’s story had come to an end by the conclusion of the fourth season and that a new detective should be at the forefront of the series.</p><p><i>Disclaimer</i>: The above information is for general informational purposes only.
