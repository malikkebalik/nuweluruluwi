As it turns out, the Glass Onion actress had an eating disorder when she was younger. And as Madelyn Cline got started on her recovery, she was on the cycle of weight gain and weight loss.</strong></p><p><strong>Madelyn Cline</strong> is an American <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>actress</strong></a> and <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>model</strong></a> who is mostly recognized for her portrayal of the roles of Sarah Cameron on the Netflix teen drama series Outer Banks and as Whiskey in <strong>Rian Johnson</strong>'s mystery film Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery. As a child, she worked on television commercials for T-mobile, Next clothing, and Sunny D. That's how she got her exposure and she soon began doing small roles such as Chloe in Boy Erased and Taylor Watts in Vice Principals.</p><p>She, later on, got cast to play small recurring roles in The Originals and Stranger Things. Her breakout role came in 2018 when she was cast to play Sarah Cameron on the Netflix mystery drama Outer Banks. Madelyn Cline gained much prominence in 2020 when the first season of the series was released. In June 2021, she joined the cast of Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery. Recently, before the release of the third season of Outer Banks, she appeared at Poguelandia, the show's first-ever fan music festival, where it was announced that the show was returning for a fourth season.</p><p>After the release of the third season of Outer Banks on Netflix on February 23, the viewers noticed that the actress looked a bit smaller than in the previous seasons. On observing that she had lost a bit of weight, they came to the realization that she had never been of stable weight, and that she was always on a cycle of weight gain and weight loss. This sparked their curiosity among people about her unstable weight. They want to know how she gained weight in the first place. Read to find out more about Madelyn Cline's weight gain!</p><p>Previously, we touched on the <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>weight gain</a></strong> stories of <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Lucinda Strafford</strong></a> and <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>IVE’s Liz</strong></a>.</p><h2>Madelyn Cline's Weight Gain: The Actress Had an Eating Disorder That Caused Her Weight to Fluctuate!</h2><p>So, <strong>Madelyn Cline</strong> (<a href=# rel=noopener>@madelyncline</a>) looks noticeably slimmer in the latest season of Outer Banks. The change in her weight was nothing drastic but it was not something the fans could ignore either. On looking back, fans realized that she had been having small weight gain and <a href=# rel=noopener>weight loss</a> throughout the show which was easily noticeable. This sparked curiosity about the reason for her unstable weight and frequent fluctuations. How did she gain weight in the first place?</p><p>Well, turns out that Madelyn Cline has been struggling with an eating disorder since she was a teenager. So, as a result of that disorder, she has been on a cycle of weight gain and weight loss for a very long time. She never was unstable when it came to her weight because it was always fluctuating as she tried to recover from the disorder and set back and started for the subsequent recovery yet again.</p><p>So, that is how Madelyn Cline had weight gain in the first place. It was the eating disorder all along. It was nothing significant to worry about except the fact that she had a disorder. But because she is not particularly tall, even the slightest change in her size is very prominent. So, recently, it was very visible that she had lost a bit of weight. However, for her, it's only a sign that she is winning in her battle with that eating disorder.</p><p>Whenever Madelyn Cline gave in to her eating disorder, it resulted in her weight gain. But, now she has been on the journey to recover from that and she is slowly getting there. She was candid about her struggles and her recovery in a <a href=# rel=noopener>Body Scan video</a> she did for Women's Health. She went into detail about her eating disorder that started during her teenage years and how it affected her body and her body image issues.</p><p>Madelyn Cline said that on realizing that she had been suffering from an eating disorder and that it was the reason behind her weight gain when she was younger, she was not aware of what to do so, she just started working out a lot. And she went hard at it. She started waking up every morning at 5 a.m. and working out for 30 minutes. She used to do rigorous cardio every day.</p><p>But it didn't work for her. Of course, weight gain didn't bother Madelyn Cline when she started all that rigorous workout but all that workout she did still didn't get her the body shape she wanted to have. So, she started restricting her eating assuming that she was falling short in the efforts and that she would get the body she wanted if she just went harder at it. She started cutting calories and would just eat six almonds for breakfast because she didn't want to counteract the cardio she just did.</p><p>When that didn't work, the rigorous dieting and workout went a little farther. The Outer Banks star was back to having an eating disorder. Weight gain was no longer a problem but she was back to square one because she stopped feeding her body what it needed when she was working out so much and she stopped feeding herself protein as well. She was dancing and she was weight-lifting. And she was working out multiple times during the day but she was not achieving a particular body image and she was so frustrated that she started harming herself and starving herself in the process of trying to achieve that.</p><p>What started out as a recovery turned out to be the problem itself. The prospect of the slightest weight gain was nothing compared to that. Eventually, Madelyn Cline made a complete recovery with the help of her mother. She learned to love her body with time and was much happier after that. She realized that "there's nothing wrong with you, you're just not built that way, and that's perfectly fine" and that was sort of her happy ending to the battle with the eating disorder.</p><p>Madelyn Cline is now slimmer and healthy all thanks to proper workout and proper dieting. Nothing rigorous and without some specific body type in mind. Just fitness and health.</p><p><strong>Visit <a href=#>House & Whips</a> for more&nbsp;<a href=#>interesting stories</a> about your favorite celebs.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6rApq3Nna6hoaCoe6S7zGikmpyVocavecKloKedXayyqrPHrWSgmZmjfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./hot-news-adam-tebben-obituary-wichita-resident-adam-tebben-dies-in-weatherford-helicopter-cras.html><span>←</span><span>Hot News!
