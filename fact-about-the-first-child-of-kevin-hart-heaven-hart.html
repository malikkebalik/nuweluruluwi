Everyone knows who her father is—his name is Kevin. He is an actor, comedian, and producer. Contrarily, Torrei works as an actor, producer, and television personality among other things.</p><p>Heaven seems to like playing the roles of her parents. She started acting classes when she was only eight years old. Heaven participates in school productions and has made two appearances in her father’s movies.</p><h2><span id=Her_parents_already_have_a_divorce>Her parents already have a divorce</span></h2><p>Heaven’s parents were already separated. The former couple reportedly experienced numerous ups and downs throughout their marriage. They started dating and were so deeply in love that they didn’t think twice before intensifying their passion.</p><p>They were wed in 2003. However, they got divorced in 2010. However, it was formally finished after a year. In addition, it is claimed that her father’s relationship with another lady was a crucial factor in their divorce.</p><h2><span id=What_is_the_number_of_siblings_in_Heaven>What is the number of siblings in Heaven?</span></h2><p>If you believe Heaven is the only kid, you are mistaken. Heaven is blessed to have two brothers who look up to her. She also has a sister named Hendrix and a half-brother named Kenzo. She adores both her half-brother and stepmother despite this.</p><p>Additionally, Heaven generously wrote a note for the couple, expressing her genuine affection for them. She adores them and is their big sister in love, joy, and gladness.</p><h2><span id=Who_is_Kevin8217s_wife_right_now>Who is Kevin’s wife right now?</span></h2><p>Eniko Parrish is Kevin’s second marriage. In 2014, these two people started dating. Eniko, on the other hand, is a model on Instagram. According to Kevin, they have been buddies since 2009. But they had kept the details of their courtship a secret.</p><p>Kevin proposed to Eniko on her 30th birthday. Before saying their vows in 2016, they had been dating for two years. They got married close to Santa Barbara, California. But Kevin, the toughest man in the world, has fought back against his wife.</p><h2><span id=Insects_make_Kevin_Hart_extremely_nervous>Insects make Kevin Hart extremely nervous</span></h2><p>Despite his fame, Kevin Hart dreads all insects, including harmless ones like grasshoppers and butterflies. Another amazing fact is that the actor had to face his bug phobias while filming Jumanji because they were present everywhere. The Rock, a co-star in the movie, insisted that he intentionally threw a fake spider Kevin’s way. It was a wonderful day, he said.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Why Ed Skrein Left Game Of Thrones And His Family Life"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1081857,"3":{"1":0},"12":0,"18":1,"23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://superstarsculture.com/why-ed-skrein-left-game-of-thrones-and-his-family-life/"}{"1":65}'>Also Read: <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Why Ed Skrein Left Game Of Thrones And His Family Life</a></span></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/superstarsculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Untitled-design-1.jpg alt="Easy way to win money online (1)" width=550 height=100 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>celebrity child</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><a href=# rel=prev><span>Previous Article</span><p>Kesha</p></a><a href=# rel=next><span>Next Article</span><p>Anne Heche</p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpaWys7%2FTmqmsm6Whwba%2BxGeaqKVfm66kwIyamaitpGLBqbGMn6Crq6RisKm1y51kqJ5doLK3tc1mn5qqpGK1pq3VnqVmoJGnwXA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./talent-a-huge-factor-why-james-bradberry-chose-eagles-after-giants.html><span>←</span><span>Talent a 'huge factor' why James Bradberry chose Eagles after Giants</span></a>
