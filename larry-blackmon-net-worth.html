Blackmon also plays the bass guitar, drums, and percussion; his career started in 1971.</p><p>Have you ever wondered how rich Larry Blackmon is, as of mid-2016? According to authoritative sources, it has been estimated that Larry Blackmon’s net worth is as high as $200,000, an amount earned through his career as a musician. In addition to being a leading member of the Cameo band, Blackmon also appeared in <a href=#>Cheech Marin</a>’s movie “Born in East L.A.” in 1987 and co-produced <a href=#>Eddie Murphy</a>’s album “So Happy” in 1989, which improved his wealth.</p><h3>Larry Blackmon Net Worth $200,000</h3><p>Larry Blackmon is a son of Lee Black, a former boxer, and grew up in Harlem where he started playing drums in the band called Black Ivory. Blackmon and Tomi Jenkins formed the East Coast group in the early ’70’s and later renamed it New York City Players before taken the new name, Cameo as of 1974.</p><p>The group consisted of 14 members initially, and their debut album “Cardiac Arrest” (1977) went out with a hit single “Rigor Mortis” that reached the No. 33 on the R&B chart, and the album itself peaked at No. 16 on the Billboard Top Soul LPs and No. 116 on the Billboard Top LPs. That same year, Cameo released another album called “We All Know Who We Are” which peaked at No. 58 on the US chart and No. 15 on the R&B chart with singles “It’s Over” and “It’s Serious”. Lary’s net worth was established.</p><p>By the end of the ’70’s, the band had released two more albums: “Ugly Ego” (1978) and “Secret Omen” (1979), with the latter being highly popular, reaching No. 46 on the US charts, and No. 4 on R&B charts, and had two Top 10 songs with “I Just Want to Be” at No. 3, and “Sparkle” at No. 10. Cameo reached the peak of their popularity in the ’80’s, starting with their best album at the time called “Cameosis” (1980) that topped the R&B album charts and peaked at No. 25 on the Billboard 200 album charts. The singles “We’re Goin’ Out Tonight” and “Shake Your Pants” reached the No. 10 and No. 11 on the R&B charts, respectively.</p><p>In the next five years, Cameo recorded six more albums: “Feel Me” (1980), “Knights of the Sound Table” (1981), “Alligator Woman” (1982), “Style” (1983), She’s Strange (1984), and “Single Life” (1985). The last two were particularly successful, but the next album is the group’s greatest and made them one of the best-paid of the decade; in 1986 “Word Up!” came out, and topped the R&B charts and reached No. 8 on the Billboard Top 200 with the singles “Word Up!” and “Candy”. Larry’s net worth was still rising.</p><p>The band went on and recorded another five albums to date: “Machismo” (1988), “Real Men… Wear Black” (1990), “Emotional Violence” (1991), “In the Face of Funk” (1994), and “Sexy Sweet Thing” (2000), but “Word Up!” remained the group’s greatest release. Blackmon has also worked with other musicians such as Ry Cooder and <a href=#>Cyndi Lauper</a>, while he is still performing with the Cameo.</p><p>Regarding his personal life, Larry Blackmon has two sons; Larry Scott Blackmon is involved with politics, while other is in the hip-hop music industry, but Larry gives nothing away about his relationships.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=2.6052631578947><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Larry Blackmon</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$200 Thousand</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>May 24, 1956</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>New York City, New York, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Singer</td></tr><tr><td>Education</td><td>Juilliard School</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>Larry Scott Blackmon</td></tr><tr readability=0.20512820512821><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0085788/</a></td></tr><tr><td>Music Groups</td><td>Cameo</td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Soundtrack <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=soundtrack readability=29.5><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr readability=2><td>Who's Doing the Dishes?</td><td>2016</td><td>TV Series writer -
