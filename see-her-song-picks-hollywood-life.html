My mother was the queen of Halloween and starting the 1st of the month, everything shifted into gear. That meant nightly horror movies, decorations galore, and reading scary stories for bedtime. My first crush was Jack Skellington.&nbsp; Halloween was consistently the best time of year throughout my childhood / young adult life and honestly, still is.&nbsp; I think my favorite thing of all though is doing the haunted hayride in Sleepy Hollow every year.</p><p id=content-paragraph-13><strong>What do you think will be the most popular Halloween costume this year? What SHOULD be, in your mind?<br></strong><br>We’ll probably see a lot of Hellfire Club Members and Catwoman costumes, but in my head I’m thinking we should all dress up as 18th-century Victorian royalty (keeping it gory though, of course).</p><p id=content-paragraph-14><strong>Do you have any particular traditions for this time of year?</strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-15>SO many.&nbsp; But every year we go to the Jack O’ Lantern carvings where they line up thousands of carved pumpkins all featuring beautifully detailed images of favorite actors, book characters, movie scenes etc.&nbsp; With no lights but the ones in the pumpkins themselves, it’s pretty spooky, but the apple cider keeps it cozy along the walk.</p><p id=content-paragraph-16><strong>If given a budget and free range to do whatever, what horror movie would you star in? You can remake any film of the past, or you could create your own.</strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-17>I would absolutely do a take on Insidious.&nbsp; I’m super interested in lucid dreaming and while failing at being able to do it myself, have always read up on it.&nbsp; As someone who consistently has sleep paralysis though, I’d want my movie to show people the infinitely terrifying ways sleep paralysis messes with your ability to rest and how once you’re in, you’ll feel like you’re never getting out.&nbsp; Maybe we even make it a virtual reality experience that could be fun.</p><p id=content-paragraph-18><strong>What’s on tap for October and the rest of the year?<br></strong><br>I’ll be announcing my first-ever headlining tour!&nbsp; I feel like I’ve been waiting my whole life to do this and the fact that it’s finally here is unbelievable. I’m also doing a cool collaboration with Apple Maps for my NYC folks where I highlight all my favorite Halloween spots to go to this season. In addition to that though, of course, October will come with new music!! It’s a track I’ve held onto for a while that has quite the spooky title to go with it.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH5xe49uZqOtnJ6ubsPOpZ1mrJiaerS71KebZqeWYrWiuMuorp6dnmLAsLrGrGY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./robin-roberts-net-worth-kahawatungu.html><span>←</span><span>Robin Roberts Net Worth - KahawaTungu</span></a>
