His fiery mixtape run with the Coke Boys and Mac & Cheese series in the late 2000s put him on the map in <a class=underline-link href=#>New York City</a>. Aforementioned hits such as “Shot Caller” and “Ain’t Worried About Nothin'” propelled him into the limelight even further.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>During his ascension, however, French Montana developed a penchant for collaborating, having teamed up on songs with the likes of Drake, Rick Ross, Lil Wayne, Nicki Minaj, Kodak Black and Swae Lee. A lot of those records, such as “Pop That,” “Unforgettable” and “No Shopping,” became some of his biggest hits.</p><a class=related-article--container href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.hiphopdx.com/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-23-at-11.53.17-AM-e1624463640260.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=related-article--tagline>related<span> news</span></p><h3 class=related-article--title>French Montana & Soulja Boy Join Forces For Upcoming ‘She Make It Clap’ Remix</h3><p class=related-article--meta-information>June 23, 2021</p></a><p>That trend has persisted. Out of the 12 singles French Montana released since 2019, only two of them don’t have a guest feature (“That’s a Fact” and “FWMGAB”). However, he’ll make that three with his new solo record he’s dropping later this week.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>Revisit “Shot Caller” below.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmigmaW1sLzDsWWcp51ku6bD0mignWZmaoF0go6toK2klWOzs7HNnJ9mpZ%2BjwaK6wGaqqKSfYrWqwIyrnJynopnA</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./anfernee-penny-hardaway-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Anfernee Penny Hardaway Net Worth</span></a>
