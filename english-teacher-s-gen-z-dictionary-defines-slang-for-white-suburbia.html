A California teacher has gone viral after he published a “Gen Z term dictionary” featuring phrases such as “no cap,” “baddie” and “getting sturdy.”
Ryan Price, an English teacher at Buckingham Charter Magnet High School, posted three videos defining the new vernacular on TikTok.
Combined, the videos have accumulated 4.6 million views. “All year long I’ve been listening to you and making a list, which I’ve compiled here for you — the Gen Z term dictionary,” said Price in his first video which was published Friday."><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

And I have our first set of revisions for us and our first one’s going to be here on our title slide,” said the teacher who revealed that several of the slang terms were derived from African American Vernacular English (AAVE).</p><p>“I know you think that you came up with all these words, but you didn’t,” stated Price. “They’ve been around for a long time, and they kind of make their way into society and into your lexicon through pop culture and things like hip-hop music and stuff may just sneak their way into your daily vocab.”</p><p>According to the educator, some of the terms are often “looked down upon by society” because it seems “uneducated” or “thuggish.”</p><p>“But then what happens is it makes its way to like old, say, white suburbia. And you get like a little dorky white dude, mislabeling it just for a whole generation as a term dictionary,” explained Price.”It ends up kind of erasing the importance of it and the impact that it has on culture.”</p><p>The teacher then changed the title of the PowerPoint to read “The AAVE-inspired Gen Z term dictionary.”</p><p>Price later told his students that “the mistake was just simply due to ignorance on my part.”</p><p>“But that’s OK, because all you’ve got to do is learn. I just write the feedback that I got, studied a little bit and learned and now I’m not so ignorant anymore,” continued Price. “Being ignorant is OK, but being willfully ignorant and not doing anything about it, not so OK.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j25manBfmruouMisn2aslZawqbHRrGSgnZ5ix26wyJyroqeelr%2B6ecOenaKmlah6tLjAp55mnp%2Bneri0yK2cZqull8KzrsiaZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./cardi-b-gets-summer-jam-ready-with-back-bending-yoga-stretches.html><span>←</span><span>Cardi B Gets Summer Jam Ready With Back-Bending Yoga Stretches</span></a>
