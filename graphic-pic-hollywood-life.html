<span>Aldo Pusey</span></p><h1>Graphic Pic Hollywood Life</h1></header><section class=post-content><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/dan-bilzerian-tweets-shooters-head-photo-ftr.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-2><strong>Dan Bilzerian</strong>, 33, took to Twitter on Oct. 4, where he posted a photo head, allegedly that of the Las Vegas shooter, <strong>Stephen Paddock</strong>, 64. The graphic photo [warning] — <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>which you can view here</a> — shows a deceased man lying in a pool of blood, spreading out from beneath his head. The man in the photo, who is surrounded by bullet casings, appears to have been shot in the head. Another photo circulating on the internet, also shows what appears to be another gun shot wound to the man’s chest. As you may know, when police found Paddock, they believed he had died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Police discovered Paddock, who was dead on arrival, in his hotel room on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Bilzarian, who’s been making headlines for his outlandish posts about the shooting, has sparked controversy online over the photo. Some Twitter users are saying that the photo is too graphic to be made public and it’s insensitive to the victims;&nbsp; while others are arguing that Paddock’s body should be exposed and that he deserves no privacy after killing&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>58 people and injuring 530</a>. While the FBI and local authorities continue to investigate the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history, Bilzarian’s latest post begs numerous questions — How did he obtain the photo? Is his photo considered an exploitation of a corpse? Is the man in the photo even Paddock? Is the photo too disturbing for individuals to view online?</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>One Twitter replied to Bilzerian’s photo, “Redo here. It was f–ked up he murdered people… and took so many lives. He deserves whatever embarrassment his corpse gets.” Another Twitter user argued, “No, actually there r these things called ‘morals and ethics.’ He’s gone. He cheated NOT saying respect him but ‘respect the dead.’ Feel me?”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Bilzerian, who was at the Las Vegas concert at the time of the shooting, has came under fire for posting his video filmed as he ran away from the concert under gunfire. As shots were fired, Bilzerian&nbsp;taped himself [as seen above]&nbsp;while reporting, “Holy f–k, this girl just got shot in the f–king head. It’s so f–king crazy… saw a girl get shot in the face right next to me; Her brains f–king hanging out.” As soon as he posted the video, people online criticized him for being insensitive about the tragedy which he had witnessed, as well as for not stopping to help others in need.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Later, Bilzerian revealed that he had in fact, helped an injured woman by <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>rescuing her</a> in his car. While running from the gunfire, Bilzerian came across an injured woman, who he picked up and transported to a nearby hospital. He informed PEOPLE magazine that he didn’t stick around to find out the extent of her injuries, as he went back to the scene to help other victims.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Paddock has been named as the shooter who slaughtered innocent Americans while they listened to country music at the Route 91 Harvest Music Festival, which 22,000 attended. Police believe Paddock committed suicide, after he launched the attack from his hotel room at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8><strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>, you can leave your thoughts in the comments below.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWlnZH5xe49tZp2ZnmKvqrjZnqmimZ5ivam706hkpZmjYsOms8CsZKygn6TBpr6MnZyanF2dsqKwjJujqKeUYsC2tcKim55lpKy2tcDEq2Y%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./capital-city-public-market-in-downtown-boise-will-open-season-in-garden-city.html><span>←</span><span>Capital City Public Market in downtown Boise will open season in Garden City</span></a>
