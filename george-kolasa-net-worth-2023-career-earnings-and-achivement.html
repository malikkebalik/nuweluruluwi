According to an Instagram post published Tuesday, donations should be made to Team George Kolasa instead of sending bouquets in his honor.</p><p>Kolasa “wanted nothing more than to continue his mission to beat rare cancers,” according to the post.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Is Deadliest Catch&#39;s Josh Harris Wed?
