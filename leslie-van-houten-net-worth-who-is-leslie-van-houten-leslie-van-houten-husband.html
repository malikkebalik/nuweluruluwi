In connection with the slayings of Leno and Rosemary LaBianca in 1969, Van Houten was detained and accused. She was found guilty and given the death sentence.

She was found guilty of two charges of murder and one count of conspiracy at her third trial in 1978 and given a seven- to life sentence.

The pair were murdered by Van Houten, Krenwinkel, and Watson.
