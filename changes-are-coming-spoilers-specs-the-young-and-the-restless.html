That is the only reason I can see that These two would be the 1st to mention the whole Jordan fiasco! Summer needs to get out of that hotel, and Harrison needs a place to run around and get to know more of her side of the family!! The house Tariah currently occupies is where Summer grew up, and it‚Äôs a great size for her and Harrison (and eventually Chance). <strong>I said what I said</strong>!</p><p>Since Claire is going to be at Newman Ranch and Summer and Harrison will be at the gatehouse, Summer will allow Claire to watch Harrison (eventually). Kyle won‚Äôt like this one bit, especially if Chance moves inüòÅ</p><p><span class=post-likes>2 Likes</span></p><p><strong>Spoilers</strong>: Nick attempts to comfort Phyllis. Phyllis responds by kissing Nick!!</p><p><strong>Specs</strong>: Phyllis and Nick hook up, vyt they are already doomed because Sharon is the love of his life and because the Summer/Billy secret will come up and bite Phyllis in the butt.
