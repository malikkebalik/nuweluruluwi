She has Colombian, German, Sephardi Jewish, Dutch, Basque, Spanish, Bolivian, and White ancestry.</p><p>Her parents have diligently fulfilled their responsibilities in providing her with the kind of life one would expect for a child born into a prominent family. Rosaline Hoss is still fully dependent on her parents, and as a result, much is not known about her.
