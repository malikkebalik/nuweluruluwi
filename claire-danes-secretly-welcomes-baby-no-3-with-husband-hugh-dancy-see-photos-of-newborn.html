The <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>My So Called Life</a> actress wore her sandy blonde hair straight, and finished the look with a necklace and a pair of eyeglasses. The <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>extremely private parents</a> placed a light blue blanket over the stroller to cover the baby. On Tuesday, July 11, the actress’s rep confirmed to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>PEOPLE</a> that the couple welcomed a baby girl, their first daughter.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/claire-danes-birth-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>Her husband Hugh walked alongside his wife wearing a pair of tan shorts, a blue button up shirt, and sneakers, and appeared to be carrying a bag of groceries. Claire and Hugh are <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>already parents</a> to sons <strong>Cyrus</strong>, 10, and <strong>Rowan</strong>, 5. Claire, who famously starred as the brilliant <strong>Temple Grandin</strong> in the HBO film about her life, has been extremely candid <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>about motherhood</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/claire-danes-birth-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>“Being a mom is incredibly challenging,” she told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Harper’s Bazaar UK</a> in a 2014 interview, 2 years after the birth of her first child. “But, we still feel a pressure to talk about it in very romantic terms. We all have that resentment&nbsp;at times and anxiety about being trapped by the role, that responsibility. And, then chemically it can run riot. Your mental state, the hormonal swings are so extraordinary and singular to the female experience, and they haven’t been taken very seriously or considered very deeply. … I mean, postpartum aside, even if you have the most healthy relationship with your child and have support and resources, it’s tough. It is really tough. And there’s no ‘off’ button. [For me] that was the hardest adjustment. You always feel beholden to somebody. And, for so long they’re like koala bears, you just feel a physical responsibility to be there for them to cling to. It’s pretty primal.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH14e5BpZpykkZ6%2FpnnDmqWeq12dwqi0jJ2Yp5upYq%2Birthmq6Ghopl6pLTIpZtmqJikwbC%2Fjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./15-unheralded-historical-hip-hop-figures-to-celebrate-black-history-month.html><span>←</span><span>15 Unheralded Historical Hip Hop Figures To Celebrate Black History Month</span></a>
