It’ll never work,” Redford told Pollack, per Hofler’s book.</p><p>Redford was also reportedly concerned with Streisand’s musical background, according to the tome. “She’s not going to sing, is she?” he asked, per Hofler. “I [don’t] want her to sing in the middle of the movie.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Streisand (right) sang “The Way We Were” for the film. <span class=credit>Getty Images</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">“The Way We Were” opened in 1973 and became a cult classic of the romance-drama genre. <span class=credit>LMPC via Getty Images</span></figure><p>The book also reported that Pollack — who died in 2008 — had previously uttered: “Barbra had never worked with a really strong leading man.”</p><p>“She has a tendency to take over a picture, just by the size of her talent and larger-than-life presence. It’s hard for a co-star to stay in the same ring with her,” the “Three Days of the Condor” director said.</p><p>Pollack had only believed that Redford could deal with the Oscar winner. “In acting, you have to sense that there’s a reserve somewhere, that you’re seeing the top of the iceberg,” Pollack said, according to Hofler’s book.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Barbra Streisand and Robert Redford starred as college sweethearts from two different worlds who try to make their relationship work. <span class=credit>FilmPublicityArchive/United Arch</span></figure><p>“Redford makes you come to him as a performer. He holds his ground, and you either enter his turf or you don’t get it. Period. He will not court you … I spent literally eight months beating him to death in order to get him to do it. I would not let him off the hook,” Pollack noted.</p><p>A sequel was even supposed to be produced with Redford and Streisand back at the helm, entitled “The Way We Changed.”</p><p>However, the “Out of Africa” star was over the role. “I didn’t, but Barbra did,” he said of sequel talks.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Sydney Pollack directed “The Way We Were,” which starred Redford (left) and Streisand.

She admitted that she still gets frustrated with people pronouncing her name incorrectly.</p><p>She explained that the proper way to say her surname is “Strei-sand,” not “Strei-zand.”</p><p>“It’s the funniest thing to me that people still can’t seem to get my name right,” she said. “Even today, I had to correct my new assistant.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3N7kGlma2xfp7yjsdGtZKudlJu8s7CMnaCdpqRixKK602aZmqqSp65uv9OrnKKrkaOxbrXNZquhnV2srrp51p5ksJ2imnw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./radha-delamarter-is-currently-married-to-her-fourth-husband-divorce-and-children.html><span>←</span><span>Radha Delamarter is currently Married to her fourth husband; Divorce and Children</span></a>
