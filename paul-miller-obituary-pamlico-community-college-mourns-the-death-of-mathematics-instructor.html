His school mourns him. Florida Marine ex-serviceman. Pamlico Community College president Dr. Jim Ross wrote to colleagues, “He was an extremely dedicated and talented full-time Math instructor who cared deeply about his students. Peers and pupils admired him. He was friendly to kids. Will miss college contributions.”<br>The president stated, “I often visited Paul and asked how he was doing. He details his academic accomplishments. We fixed a serious issue his students had with a publishing company that delayed book deliveries three weeks ago at his request.</p><p>His passion in our chats and the emails he copied me on as he led this battle amazed me. He defeated this publisher for students. One of Paul’s many student aids.” Ross said, “I called Jennifer, Paul’s wife, tonight (Saturday) at her request. I saw her poise and resolve as we spoke. Her concern for Paul’s students pushed me to speak. Her shock and grief showed she cared about Paul’s Monday morning kids. I appreciate her letting me tell her we loved her husband during such a difficult time.</p><p>A great teacher and young fighter, I said. Supporting Mrs. Miller. Announce funerals, she said. We’ll reveal.” As I close this painful email, please pray for Paul, Mrs. Miller, and his family. My experience shows that trust and prayers for God’s blessings are always necessary. Honoring loved ones by hugging them. We have limited time in this miracle called life. Nobody knows when they or their loved ones will die. We know they’ll end. Avoid missing the most crucial family discussion. Express your feelings. Bless your family always.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZbDprrLsmSmnZ2kv6qty6xlnKedZL2iwctmpKKknJq%2FbrvBoquumaKuerGtzKWgnKddmLyuudSnoK2xXZi8rbjEoJxmpZ%2Bqv6%2B%2FjK2fnmWUmq61tIyonWalkam1prnAraCcq12eu7TA0a6araeiZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kenneth-banach-obituary-celebrating-the-life-of-a-passionate-and-committed-firefighter.html><span>←</span><span>Kenneth Banach Obituary: Celebrating the Life of a Passionate and Committed Firefighter</span></a>
