She also starred in&nbsp;Green Lantern,&nbsp;<span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Age of Adaline,&nbsp;and&nbsp;The Shallows.</p><p>She proved to fans and critics alike that she is more than just eye-candy and owes much of her acting success to her parents Ernie and Elaine Lively.&nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>She&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">told&nbsp;W Magazine</a>; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>My mom and dad always taught acting, so instead of getting me babysitters, they would just bring me to class. And I’m a naturally shy person, so it really helped. I would’ve just been hiding under the table, pulling on my mother’s dress if I hadn’t been in their classes.&nbsp;</p><h2>Ernie Lively</h2><p>When Lively&nbsp;starred&nbsp;in her debut movie,&nbsp;The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants,&nbsp;she did it with her father, Ernie Lively, who played the father to&nbsp;Lively’s character.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Ernie’s role in that movie came decades after his showbiz career started in the 1970s.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>On the big screen, Ernie had roles in films and TV, including&nbsp;The Waltons, Fantasy Island, The Dukes of Hazzard, Murder, She Wrote,&nbsp;and&nbsp;The West Wing.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>But before becoming an actor, Ernie was an English professor and a US Marine Corps Captain who served in Vietnam.</p><p>He eventually got married to Elaine, Lively’s mom, after she ended her previous marriage. Ernie dropped his last name, Brown, and took Elaine’s last name.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Ernie and Elaine are parents to Lively’s older brother, Eric. They are also parents to Robyn Lively, Lori Lively, and Jason Lively, whom Elaine had from her previous marriage.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In 2013, Ernie underwent groundbreaking retrograde gene therapy heart surgery that involved injecting his own stem cells into his heart to repair damaged muscle and arteries.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Unfortunately, on June 3, Ernie passed away from cardiac complications in Los Angeles.&nbsp;</p><h2>Elaine Lively</h2><p>Although Elaine has not spoken out about her husband’s death yet, it goes without saying that she is in deep mourning over the loss of her longtime husband.</p><p>As a wife, mother, and grandmother of the Lively family, she has remained the devoted matriarch of her family and has a respectable career.</p><p>Like her daughter and her late husband, Elaine&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">worked&nbsp;in the industry</a>, but she preferred to be behind the scenes. She worked as a talent manager for some pretty high-profile stars, but she did not get involved in acting throughout her career, unlike the other family members.&nbsp;</p><p>Her only appearance outside of talent managing was in a 1993 video game called&nbsp;Return to Zork, where she voiced a character named Milly.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-618 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJqclrimecuirZ6kqWK9or7Ep6usZpipuq0%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-old-is-tiffany-ortiz-height-weight-instagram-wiki-and-biography.html><span>←</span><span>How Old Is Tiffany Ortiz?
