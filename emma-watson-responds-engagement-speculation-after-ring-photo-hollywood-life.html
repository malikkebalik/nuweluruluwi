It was a simple band, and in no way guaranteed proof that either Leo or Emma popped the question. Regardless, the photos excited fans, especially considering that Emma and Leo have been romantically linked together for nearly two years.<p id=content-paragraph-15>Emma and Leo first sparked dating rumors in Oct. 2019, when they were <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>seen kissing</a> outside of Gail’s Bakery in Notting Hill in London. Their relationship status remained unclear, however, because Emma revealed that she was “self-partnered” but “going on dates” in a profile for British Vogue that came out in December of that year (however, the interview could’ve been conducted before Emma and Leo became serious).</p><p id=content-paragraph-16>However, fans did receive more insight into Emma and Leo’s still-rumored romance by April of 2020. By then, a report claimed that “Emma introduced Leo to her parents” and that “she was really serious about him,” per Daily Mail Online. The couple also “did everything in their power to keep their relationship private,” a source told the outlet. In light of Emma’s new tweets, though, it looks like the&nbsp;Bling Ring&nbsp;star won’t be keeping private if she does have big news to share though!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWphZH12e5BwZp6lnZZ6uK3TrKanZaKawLG7zZ2qZp2enK6oscyepa1lo6WypMHLmquip55iv6q6xmajnqddp7yjtc2tpqdlk5a%2FprHRaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./difference-between-synecdoche-and-metonymy.html><span>←</span><span>Difference Between Synecdoche And Metonymy</span></a>
