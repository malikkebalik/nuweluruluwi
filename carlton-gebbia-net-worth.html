Carlton`s career has been active since the early 1990s.</p><p>Have you ever wondered how rich Carlton Gebbia is, as of late 2016? According to authoritative sources, it has been estimated that Gebbia’s net worth is as high as $150 million, an amount earned through her successful career as an actress, television personality, and designer.</p><h3>Carlton Gebbia Net Worth $150 Million</h3><p>Although born in South Africa, Carlton moved to London with her parents, where she attended high school, but after matriculation she moved to Los Angeles in 1993, in order to pursue her dreams of becoming an actress.</p><p>Only a year after her move to the States, Carlton made her debut in the film “Eyes of the Serpent” (1994), and subsequently appeared in the film “Sexperiment”. She ended the decade with appearances in the TV series “Suddenly Susan” (1999), and soap opera “The Young and the Restless” (1999), all of which were the basis of her net worth.</p><p>With the beginning of the new millennium, Carlton switched her focus to interior designing, but still appeared in “Time Share” (2000) with <a href=#>Timothy Dalton</a> and <a href=#>Nastassja Kinski</a>, and “Pretty When You Cry” alongside <a href=#>Sam Elliott</a> and <a href=#>Jamie Kennedy</a>, both of which increased her net worth by a large amount. However, her life began changing when she met <a href=#>David Gebbia</a>, who later became her husband. He is a businessman – a real estate developer and investor – owning several companies in the industry, including Gebbia Custom Estates, Rival Sports Group and StockCross Financial companies. Marrying him helped Carlton to increased her net worth to a large degree, by default.</p><p>Though she was concentrating on interior designing, she stayed active on screen; she has been featured in Bravo`s reality TV show “The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” since 2010, which has also increased her net worth. Furthermore, Carlton is working on a screenplay for a horror film, and on a children`s book, which will also likely add to her net worth, once completed.</p><p>Regarding her personal life, the Gebbia couple married in 1998, and had three children together, and resided in a Beverly Hills 12,800 square foot mansion, which is valued at around $20 million. However, strong rumours suggest that the pair separated in September 2017, to be confirmed.</p><p>Apart from her successful careers, Carlton is a devoted animal rights activist, and declares her-self as a Wiccan.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=12.426861702128><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$150 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>October 17, 1973</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>London, United Kingdom</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Actress</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>British</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Spouse</td><td>David Gebbia (m. 1997-2016)</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Children</td><td>Mysteri Gebbia, Destiny Gebbia</td></tr><tr readability=0.28><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://twitter.com/carltongebbia13?lang=en</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.26470588235294><td>Instagram</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/carltongebbia/?hl=en</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.25806451612903><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>www.imdb.com/name/nm0253745</a></td></tr><tr readability=10><td>Movies</td><td>“Suddenly Susan” (1996), “Eyes of the Serpent” (1994), “Pretty When You Cry” (2001), “Time Share” (2000), “The Sexperiment” (1998), “The Napoleon Murder Mystery” (TV Movie documentary, 2000)</td></tr><tr readability=9><td>TV Shows</td><td>“The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” (2010- present), “Lady Gaga: G.U.Y.” (Video short, 2014), “The Playboy Morning Show” (TV Series, 2014), “Suddenly Susan” (1999),</td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Actress <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=actress readability=3><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr readability=2><td>Lady Gaga: G.U.Y.</td><td>2014</td><td>Video short</td><td>The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills Band (as Carlton Gebbia)</td></tr><tr><td>Pretty When You Cry</td><td>2001</td><td></td><td>Sara Carreni</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Time Share</td><td>2000</td><td></td><td>Felice Templeton (as Carlton Elizabeth Gebia)</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>The Young and the Restless</td><td>1999</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Janina</td></tr><tr><td>Suddenly Susan</td><td>1999</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Jeanine</td></tr><tr><td>The Sexperiment</td><td>1998</td><td></td><td>Joan (as Carlton Lynx)</td></tr><tr><td>Eyes of the Serpent</td><td>1994</td><td></td><td>Raven (as Carlton Lynx)</td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Self <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=self readability=3><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr readability=2><td>The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills</td><td>2013-2015</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Herself</td></tr><tr><td>The Playboy Morning Show</td><td>2014</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Herself</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>The Napoleon Murder Mystery</td><td>2000</td><td>TV Movie documentary as Carlton Elizabeth Gebbia</td><td></td></tr></table><h3>Known for movies</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/networthpost.org/wp-content/themes/net-worth/images/celebrity_net_worth.png><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/movies.networthpost.org/movies/thumbs/253745_Carlton-Elizabeth/253745_The-Real-Housewives-of-Beverly-Hills-20132015.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/movies.networthpost.org/movies/thumbs/253745_Carlton-Elizabeth/253745_Pretty-When-You-Cry-2001.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/movies.networthpost.org/movies/thumbs/253745_Carlton-Elizabeth/253745_Lady-Gaga-GUY-2014.jpg><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlanEsL7Toaeoq6RjvLOzjpyYq6SkpLtus8SbmaKZXaOytXnWqKmtoF8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./queer-eye-star-tan-france-proudly-announces-he-is-expecting-a-baby-with-his-husband-rob.html><span>←</span><span> 'Queer Eye' Star Tan France Proudly Announces He Is Expecting a Baby with His Husband Rob</span></a>
