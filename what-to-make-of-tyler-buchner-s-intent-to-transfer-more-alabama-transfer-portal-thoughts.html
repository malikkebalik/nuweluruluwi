<span>Reinaldo Massengill</span></p><h1>What to make of Tyler Buchners intent to transfer, more Alabama transfer portal thoughts</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>TUSCALOOSA, Ala. ‚Äî The <a href=#>transfer portal</a> officially opened on Monday, and while Alabama‚Äôs focus is on the upcoming <a href=#>College Football Playoff</a>, one of the most interesting portal entries emerged from Tuscaloosa. Sophomore quarterback <a class=ath_autolink data-id=Kd5Sb9ftOh9nKz7E href=#>Tyler Buchner</a>, who transferred in from <a class=ath_autolink data-id=216 href=#>Notre Dame</a> in the spring, has re-entered the portal, this time as a lacrosse player.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>Buchner, who started against <a class=ath_autolink data-id=157 href=#>South Florida</a> in Week 3 and finished this season completing 8 of 19 passes for 61 yards and added one rushing touchdown, used his one-time transfer in football to move from Notre Dame to Alabama. Since he‚Äôs entering the portal for a different sport, he‚Äôll be eligible to play lacrosse immediately at his next school. If he chooses to play football, he would have to sit for a year because he hasn‚Äôt graduated. From the lacrosse lens, there‚Äôs a reason to believe that he will draw interest.</p><p>Before fully committing to football, Buchner was a lacrosse phenom. He committed to play at Michigan in 2017 as a middle schooler, and in the seventh grade, he was clocked shooting a lacrosse ball at 100 mph. According to Inside Lacrosse, an ESPN affiliate site that covers the sport, Buchner held a 94/100 grade, which made him one of the highest rated players in his class nationally at that time. He played lacrosse in high school for The Bishop‚Äôs School in La Jolla, Calif.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Here's Tyler Buchner shooting 100 MPH in 7th grade üíØ</p><p>(via <a href=#>@MadDogLax</a>) <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/i5FtFTS6sF</a></p><p>‚Äî TLN ü•ç (@LacrosseNetwork) <a href=#>December 4, 2023</a></p><p>Buchner‚Äôs intended transfer drops <a class=ath_autolink data-id=263 href=#>Alabama</a>‚Äôs quarterback group from five scholarship players to four: <a class=ath_autolink data-id=rbDmj7hJciQ6JUGn href=#>Jalen Milroe</a>, <a class=ath_autolink data-id=TayP40hjp8AK8AUn href=#>Ty Simpson</a>, <a class=ath_autolink data-id=RzQ8UBxWUNQvfPYI href=#>Dylan Lonergan</a> and <a class=ath_autolink data-id=2hLapXIyqRnKsbKw href=#>Eli Holstein</a>. But five-star prospect Julian Sayin will be a midseason enrollee, and Alabama will be back to five in January.</p><p>That wasn‚Äôt the only portal decision out of Alabama on Monday: Wide receiver <a class=ath_autolink data-id=EqjqFvTZihbGJjF2 href=#>Thaiu Jones-Bell</a> was the other. The class of 2020 recruit did not play this season due to an unspecified medical issue, which was made known on the first day of preseason camp in August.</p><p>Coach Nick Saban said during Sunday‚Äôs Rose Bowl teleconference that he planned to have an open door at his office on Monday for any players with questions about their next move, whether it‚Äôs transferring, declaring for the 2024 NFL Draft or returning. Otherwise, the next few weeks provide a little downtime before bowl practice ramps up.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>Playoff practice will begin in mid-December, and in the meantime, players will participate in organized lifting and running and some 7-on-7 drills on their own while the focus shifts to final exams in their classes. But the coaches will be busy with roster management between the portal and finishing up on the high school recruiting trail before early signing day on Dec. 20.</p><p>Historically, Playoff teams haven‚Äôt faced a lot of player movement leading up to the games, mostly because players want to see the championship hunt through. There‚Äôs a small window after the championship game for players on Playoff teams to enter the portal. But Alabama can keep tabs on players entering from other programs, host them on visits and secure commitments. The brief portal era suggests Alabama will be active to some degree: Last season the team secured tight end <a class=ath_autolink data-id=JQomsyGnPK7v6Sqr href=#>CJ Dippre</a> from Maryland in December. In 2021, while competing in the Playoff, Alabama landed <a class=ath_autolink data-id=nAtwqhbjb2L5XKuR href=#>Jahmyr Gibbs</a> and <a class=ath_autolink data-id=NYd0HAhFv7LX5Ak9 href=#>Eli Ricks</a>.</p><p>There‚Äôs no shortage of talent available, but Alabama will take a targeted approach, much like it has during the past few years, to add veterans who can supplement its roster. Spring usually has been a busier period in terms of commitments, but there are a few position groups that Alabama could target in the portal.</p><h2>Running back</h2><p>Presumably, Alabama will lose its two leading rushers in seniors <a class=ath_autolink data-id=NYahI7MGLVYu0ZB5 href=#>Jase McClellan</a> and <a class=ath_autolink data-id=4s6hXi2qcktH9g9s href=#>Roydell Williams</a>, leaving just three scholarship running backs: sophomore Jamarion Miller and freshmen <a class=ath_autolink data-id=7j3hjErd63OHRbzV href=#>Justice Haynes</a> and <a class=ath_autolink data-id=WiyOCL9La7L7zucu href=#>Richard Young</a>. It‚Äôs also worth noting that Alabama does not have any running back commitments in its 2024 recruiting class. Outside of McClellan‚Äôs recent foot injury, this group has been healthy this season, but three running backs likely won‚Äôt suffice for next season, from a depth standpoint and a functionality standpoint in practice between the first-, second- and third-team offense and the scout team. That could change in the next few weeks as there are high school prospects still at play, and landing a commitment would be a boost; think back to last season and how <a class=ath_autolink data-id=jUVjabh8yOYnCIwL href=#>Kadyn Proctor</a>‚Äôs December flip nullified a need for a tackle out of the portal.</p><p>One of the biggest challenges in recruiting running backs out of the portal is that it‚Äôs a position where it‚Äôs almost required to promise a featured role (see Gibbs). Alabama has a promising young core with Miller, Haynes and Young, but there‚Äôs no questioning the numbers. Plus, some hybrid players could fill backfield duties if needed like receivers <a class=ath_autolink data-id=p8j5aMwiuvCXqHsO href=#>Kendrick Law</a>, who already has been doing some of that, or <a class=ath_autolink data-id=cCy4LhjpOYLr6e1p href=#>Emmanuel Henderson Jr.</a>, who was one of the top-rated high school backs in the 2022 cycle before switching to receiver.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><h2>Outside linebacker</h2><p>Alabama‚Äôs recruiting prowess at linebacker, particularly outside backer, means there‚Äôs plenty of young talent on the roster, but it‚Äôs hard to ignore the production and experience leaving. Dallas Turner and <a class=ath_autolink data-id=oMobZsU45pcQLp75 href=#>Chris Braswell</a> likely will leave, while senior <a class=ath_autolink data-id=KX6XVttGJDrOnhEB href=#>Quandarrius Robinson</a> could come back but participated in this year‚Äôs senior day ceremony.</p><p>The next wave behind them is sophomore <a class=ath_autolink data-id=Eh4zNW4Ezc3MWl02 href=#>Keanu Koht</a>, who flashed a few times in blowout games and redshirt freshman <a class=ath_autolink data-id=YqGvklh3n1vx2PIO href=#>Jeremiah Alexander</a>, who is starting to transition to playing inside linebacker largely similar to <a class=ath_autolink data-id=NRgiZJ8EyFvzDcMP href=#>Jihaad Campbell</a>‚Äôs path. Alabama stacked talent in its 2023 class with <a class=ath_autolink data-id=QCHnFwnpL3i8PcQs href=#>Keon Keeley</a>, <a class=ath_autolink data-id=QbZLYZvW60C7PWqe href=#>Yhonzae Pierre</a> and <a class=ath_autolink data-id=EQjrLzwjZHlKTPNV href=#>Qua Russaw</a>. The talent is there, but adding a proven, veteran presence can‚Äôt hurt.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2023/12/04183451/USATSI_19063617-scaled-e1701733257447.jpg alt width=2496 height=1663 sizes="(max-width: 2496px) 100vw, 2496px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class=table-cell-span></span> <span class=credits-text>Thaiu Jones-Bell did not play for Alabama this season. (Gary Cosby Jr. / USA Today)</span><h2>Wide receiver</h2><p>Jones-Bell‚Äôs departure adds to the statistic that between the 2020-2022 recruiting cycles, seven of the 13 wide receiver signees are no longer with the team. And senior <a class=ath_autolink data-id=nTuSLcCkkqNeprvI href=#>Jermaine Burton</a> is likely entering the NFL Draft after this season. There‚Äôs good depth with players like <a class=ath_autolink data-id=VTIIWT9xaqBf2n4e href=#>Isaiah Bond</a>, <a class=ath_autolink data-id=S6n1rLxwN6xIBVbL href=#>Ja‚ÄôCorey Brooks</a>, <a class=ath_autolink data-id=jQIygT9VIBwiTqBv href=#>Malik Benson</a>, <a class=ath_autolink data-id=uztcqtS5WiHQuAJO href=#>Kobe Prentice</a>, Law and <a class=ath_autolink data-id=BEEF2elgAljgi5fI href=#>Jalen Hale</a>, but there‚Äôs always a chance for further attrition (as has been the case the past few years), and Alabama never can have enough dangerous pass catchers.</p><p>Alabama only has two high school receivers committed: four-star prospects Amari Jefferson and Rico Scott. So there‚Äôs not a big number coming in, which could open spots via the portal. Several well-known commodities have entered from across the country, and the talent pool will get bigger in the coming days.</p><h2>Secondary</h2><p>The depth issue in the secondary leaving spring practice prompted the Alabama staff to add <a class=ath_autolink data-id=xhgECBCrDjgbIyns href=#>Trey Amos</a> and <a class=ath_autolink data-id=W2DiAoA8joAsNeYM href=#>Jaylen Key</a>, who have been stellar this season. There‚Äôs more attrition on the way with the possibility of four starters leaving after the season: Key, Kool-Aid McKinstry, <a class=ath_autolink data-id=u2pzvqCFH2kbOnLQ href=#>Terrion Arnold</a> and <a class=ath_autolink data-id=g34MDAVwo2RGdkXY href=#>Malachi Moore</a>. Alabama responded on the recruiting trail with arguably the best defensive back haul in the country with six commitments (five of them four-star prospects or higher), but the program could opt for seeking veterans via the portal.</p><p>There‚Äôs a skeleton for next year‚Äôs starting secondary with Amos and <a class=ath_autolink data-id=rwZCChzsfqC23oJe href=#>Caleb Downs</a> returning. Senior <a class=ath_autolink data-id=QWWq7A0LNWz209l1 href=#>Kristian Story</a> did not participate in the senior day ceremony, which could signify a return, and redshirt freshman Earl Little Jr, a starter during spring, should see a bigger role next season. Adding more veterans to mix with the upcoming young talent already in place and arriving soon would fill out this group nicely.</p><p>(Top photo: Julio Aguilar / Getty Images)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqutbTLnquim16YvK57lGpoa2toZnxzfJFsZmpqX2WBcMDYpZyrZZKqsKm6xKtkmqSRl66urYytqZqmo5uys3nPqKmtmZxk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./visa-is-sued-over-vanilla-gift-card-scam-known-as-draining.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Visa is sued over 'Vanilla' gift card scam known as 'draining'</span></a>
