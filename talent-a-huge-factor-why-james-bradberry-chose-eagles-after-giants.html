He knew from across NFC East enemy lines that the Eagles — coming off a one-and-done playoff appearance with then-questions <a href=#>about now-MVP candidate Jalen Hurts’ future</a> — had the pieces to make a deep run.&nbsp;</p><p>“It played a huge factor,” Bradberry said Sunday night, inside a locker room <a href=#>celebrating its berth in Super Bowl 2023</a>. “I wanted to go to a team that had a good defense and had some weapons on offense that could move the ball. That’s why I ended up choosing here. It’s worked out so far.”&nbsp;</p><p>The quickest way for Giants general manager Joe Schoen to clean up the salary-cap mess created by predecessor Dave Gettleman’s kick-the-can restructures and free-agent overpays to Kenny Golladay and Kyle Rudolph <a href=#>was to dump Bradberry</a>.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/01/1455098403.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/01/GettyImages-1423678787.jpg><p>Schoen waited past a point when $2 million of Bradberry’s salary became guaranteed — lowering the Giants’ salary-cap savings from $12.1 million to $10.1 million — but ultimately couldn’t get a deal done in part because Bradberry wasn’t willing to redo his contract to play for the losing Texans after the two teams reached a trade contingent on a new contract, as first reported by The Athletic.&nbsp;</p><p>The wait cost Bradberry, whose Giants’ salary would have been $13.4 million, a chance at big free-agent money in March. He settled for a one-year, $7.25 million deal with the Eagles.&nbsp;</p><p>“I definitely understood their point,” Bradberry said. “It was one of the ways where I was able to relax more about the situation. They were trying to get something back for me because I was a commodity from a business standpoint.”&nbsp;</p><p>By the final phase of OTAs, however, patience wore thin on both sides. Bradberry signed with the Eagles nine days after he was cut.&nbsp;</p><p>“At that time, I was just sad not to have a job,” Bradberry said. “What I was focusing on this whole year was making sure I did my part. I know we have a great team here and let’s go dominate.”&nbsp;</p><p>Mission accomplished on both fronts. Bradberry, who was a Pro Bowler in his first season with the Giants in 2020, bounced back from a substandard 2021 to allow just two touchdowns on 94 targets and rank as the No. 18 cornerback in the NFL, per Pro Football Focus. He is set up for a big free-agent payday.&nbsp;</p><p>“It was a blessing in disguise,” Bradberry said. “Just have to keep it going.”&nbsp;</p><p>As a bonus, Bradberry got the last laugh with three wins over the Giants, including one in the NFC Divisional Round, when he intercepted Daniel Jones.&nbsp;</p><p>“It was kind of ironic that I got released by them and I had an impact in sending them home,” Bradberry said. “A top-three moment in my career.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j2pmbGhfqa6tsc2tZJplmKq0pnnFmpqtp6JixKnFjKOYpp2jYq%2BzrcObnKuqqWKwqbvSnmSemZehsrR5wJ%2BrnqpdnLaiutOsZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./skid-maher-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Skid Maher Net Worth</span></a>
