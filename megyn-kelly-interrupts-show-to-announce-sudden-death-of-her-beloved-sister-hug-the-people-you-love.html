In fact, the journalist said her parents told her she was not special, which lifted all the weight of trying to be an extraordinary kid.</p><p class=Fg>So as a parent Kelly has taken on the same route. The talk show host <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=http://people.com/parents/megyn-kelly-motherhood-embarrassing-moments-misses-naps/>described</a> herself as an easygoing parent and said all she wants is for her children to be comfortable in their skin because she's always been proud of who she was.</p><p><h2 class=Jg><strong class=Dg>Megyn Kelly and Her Husband, Douglas Brunt, Almost Didn't Walk Down the Aisle</strong></h2></p><p class=Fg><a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.marieclaire.com/culture/a30148374/who-is-douglas-brunt/>According</a> to Marie Claire, Kelly and Brunt met on a blind date. Before the talk show host met him, she asked her friends to go to the restaurant and secretly check him out.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/61fa2688f4b5a61095c9e6d37cbb5ae3.jpg><p class=Vi data-testid=image-source>Megyn Kelly in Philadelphia 2017. | Source: Getty images</p><p class=Fg>The girls <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.marieclaire.com/culture/a30148374/who-is-douglas-brunt/>confirmed</a> that he was a good-looking guy, so Kelly showed up to her date. However, it quickly stopped being about looks for the journalist because she revealed that Brunt seemed sincere and attentive. To top it off, Kelly found him intelligent and funny.</p><p class=Fg>A few things almost led to the couple not getting married. Firstly it was the distance, <a class="Xd a" href=#>Kelly</a> had just moved to New York after getting a job at Fox News, and Brunt was the CEO of a tech company in Florida.</p><p class=Fg>Then something happened that caused a big fight between the couple, <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.marieclaire.com/culture/a30148374/who-is-douglas-brunt/>stated</a> Marie Claire. On one New Year's Eve night, Kelly and Brunt were walking her two dogs, and Brunt accidentally lost control of one of the dogs.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/86cfcb9179b07002e7ce304b0de8fcd3.jpg><p class=Vi data-testid=image-source>Megyn Kelly and Douglas Brunt in New York in 2017. | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=Fg>The dog ran into the street and almost got hit by a car. Brunt apologized, but the situation turned into a big fight. The journalist <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.marieclaire.com/culture/a30148374/who-is-douglas-brunt/>reportedly</a> accused him of wanting to kill her dog.</p><p class=Fg>However, Brunt already had plans to pop the question and wanted to wait until he bought a better ring. But he was impatient and settled for a look-alike of Rose's ring from Titanic that he got at a costume store.</p><p class=Fg>As per Marie Claire, Brunt <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.marieclaire.com/culture/a30148374/who-is-douglas-brunt/>asked</a> Kelly to marry him when they sat seaside on a bench in New Jersey. The talk show host confessed that she was stunned when it happened and took a while to give Brunt an answer, automatically making him think the proposal was a failure.</p><p class=Fg>But it all worked out for the couple. They married in 2008, became a family of five, and now reside in New York. The former CEO is also a book enthusiast, <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.marieclaire.com/culture/a30148374/who-is-douglas-brunt/>reported</a> Marie Claire, and a best-selling author of "Ghosts of Manhattan."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmtwb25oZ3quscaypWajlaG5unnIp6ueqqKqvbW%2FjKyfqK9dlruvu9Snmp5lo6qxb7TTpqM%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./has-she-had-botox-and-cheek-implants.html><span>←</span><span>Has She Had Botox and Cheek Implants?</span></a>
