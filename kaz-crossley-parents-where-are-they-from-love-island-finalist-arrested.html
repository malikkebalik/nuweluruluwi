After she started dating fellow ‘Love Island’ candidate Josh Denzel, Crossley attracted more media attention. She is once more in the limelight. The well-known Love Island personality was jailed in Dubai for drug offenses. The focus of today’s piece is Kaz Crossley’s family, upbringing, and parents.</p><h2><span id=Where_Are_the_Parents_of_Kaz_Crossley_from>Where Are the Parents of Kaz Crossley from?</span></h2><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/superstarsculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Untitled-design-1.jpg alt="Easy way to win money online (1)" width=550 height=100 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p class=toc_title>Page Contents</p><ul class=toc_list><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">1</span> Where Are the Parents of Kaz Crossley from?</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">2</span> Kaz Crossley, a finalist on Love Island 2018, was detained in Dubai for a drug case</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">3</span> Arrest of Kaz Crossley: She Can’t Contact Her Family</a></li></ul><p>On January 19, 1994, Kazimir Crossley, also known as Kaz Crossley, was born in England. The finalist from Love Island Season 4 is Thai, though. The self-described Thai princess once published a message on social media stating that she is genuinely proud of her Thai heritage. On a romantic picnic, she shared more about her family after Josh Denzel enquired about her origins and her ancestry.</p><p>The 29-year-old cosmetics artist disclosed that she lives with her mother, brother, and her mother’s boyfriend. Thailand is the motherland of Kaz Crossley. Her biological Father’s identity has not been made known. If you’re wondering whether the reality TV star speaks any Thai, the answer is yes—she does.</p><p>The parents of Crossley and Denzel were introduced before the Love Island 2018 finale. Early in 2019, the Love Island season four couple split up.</p><h2><span id=Kaz_Crossley_a_finalist_on_Love_Island_2018_was_detained_in_Dubai_for_a_drug_case>Kaz Crossley, a finalist on Love Island 2018, was detained in Dubai for a drug case</span></h2><p>Kaz Crossley, a former Love Island celebrity, is currently incarcerated in Dubai for drug-related offenses. According to reports, the influencer was detained at the airport in Abu Dhabi while she awaited a flight to Thailand. Investigators in the United Arab Emirates are reportedly still looking into a 2-year-old video that leaked online showing her snorting an unidentified white drug at a party, which is why it’s thought that her name was flagged.</p><p>To escape restrictions in the UK, the reality television personality flew to Dubai. While the city was on lockdown, the video was captured. Due to the rigorous laws and regulations prohibiting drinking and using drugs in Dubai and Abu Dhabi, the reality television star may spend at least three months in jail and have to pay a fine of £5,000.</p><p>Drug possession, even in trace amounts, is harshly penalized in Dubai and is susceptible to terms of up to 20 years in prison because to the UAE’s zero-tolerance stance against drug-related offenses.</p><h2><span id=Arrest_of_Kaz_Crossley_She_Can8217t_Contact_Her_Family>Arrest of Kaz Crossley: She Can’t Contact Her Family</span></h2><p>Authorities allegedly forbade Kaz from calling her family following her arrest on Monday, according to The Sun. The social media star was only allowed to send one email and was not allowed to call her family, a source told the outlet. Crossley asked her to inform her family that she was okay but had been arrested for drug crimes in an email to a specific acquaintance whose email address she could recall.</p><p>She possessed nothing that would have supported an arrest. In addition, the Foreign Office spokeswoman stated that following the detention of a British national in the United Arab Emirates, they are in communication with the local authorities.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: How Does Katie George, An ESPN Sporyscaster, Get Paid?"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":301184,"10":2,"14":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"15":"Arial","18":1,"21":1}' data-sheets-hyperlink=https://superstarsculture.com/what-does-katie-george-an-espn-sportscaster-get-paid/ data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://superstarsculture.com/what-does-katie-george-an-espn-sportscaster-get-paid/"}{"1":65}'><a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Also Read: </a><a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>How Does Katie George, An ESPN Sporyscaster, Get Paid?</a></span></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/superstarsculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Untitled-design-1.jpg alt="Easy way to win money online (1)" width=550 height=100 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>former Love Island star</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><a href=# rel=prev><span>Previous Article</span><p>How Old Is American Idol Contestant Tyson Venegas?
