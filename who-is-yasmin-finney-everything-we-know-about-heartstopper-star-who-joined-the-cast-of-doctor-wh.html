Still, none of them can be as enthusiastic as Finney herself. She revealed that if anybody had told her as a child that she would star on the evergreen show, she would have laughed it off, never believing. In her <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-manchester-61472708>words</a>:</p><p class=dh>"This show has a place in so many people's hearts, so to be seen as a trans actress by the legend himself, Russell, has not only made my year, it's made my life."</p><p class=dh>Finney expressed anxiousness to start the journey and introduce everyone to Rose.

Her page on Tiktok was created in 2019, the same year Finney decided to document her queer journey.</p><p class=dh>She has admitted that she had always known deep down that she wanted to be an actress, and since black trans people are not represented enough in the UK, it didn't take a lot for her to decide becoming an actor would help people like her gain more exposure.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>ALL WE KNOW SO FAR ABOUT THE NEW ERA OF "DOCTOR WHO?"</strong></p><p class=dh>According to some reports, an episode of the new "Doctor Who" season will be <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://thetab.com/uk/2022/05/17/everything-we-know-about-upcoming-new-era-of-doctor-who-251636>released </a>as early as autumn this year, and it will be one of the last to air before Davies takes over as the showrunner.</p><p class=dh>The episode will deal with the small matter of the regeneration of the Thirteenth Doctor and the arrival of Ncuti Gatwa as the fourteenth doctor after Jodie regenerates.</p><p class=dh><a class="me a" href=#>Gatwa</a> secured a spot on the "Doctor Who" cast earlier this month.
