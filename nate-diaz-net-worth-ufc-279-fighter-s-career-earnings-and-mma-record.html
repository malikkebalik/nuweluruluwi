[9]</p><p style=text-align:justify>Diaz’s first professional mixed martial arts fight was for <strong>World Extreme Cagefighting (WEC). In 2006, at WEC 24</strong>, he fought Hermes Franca for the <strong>WEC Lightweight Championship</strong> and lost in the second round by submission. This was the last event put on by <strong>WEC before it was bought by Zuffa, LLC,</strong> the company that owned the UFC at the time.</p><h3 style=text-align:justify><span id=Ultimate_Fighting_Championship class=mw-headline>Ultimate Fighting Championship</span></h3><h4 style=text-align:justify><span id=The_Ultimate_Fighter_5 class=mw-headline><i>The Ultimate Fighter 5</i></span></h4><p style=text-align:justify>Diaz was a fighter on Jens Pulver’s team on <strong>The Ultimate Fighter 5,</strong> which only had lightweights as competitors. In the preliminary round, Diaz beat Rob Emerson by submission. In the quarterfinals, he beat Corey Hill, who was also on Team Pulver, by submission in the first round with a triangle choke.</p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Diaz beat Team Penn member Gray Maynard by submission in the semifinal</strong>s. This put him in the finals, where he faced teammate Manvel Gamburyan. Gamburyan had to tap out in the second round because he had dislocated his right shoulder trying to do a takedown. This meant that Diaz won by submission. &nbsp;With the win, Diaz won the fifth season of The Ultimate Fighter.</p><h4 style=text-align:justify>2021</h4><p style=text-align:justify>For the first time ever, a fight that wasn’t for a title or the main event was set for 5 rounds, and it was Diaz vs. Leon Edwards at UFC 262 on May 15, 2021. In the end, the fight went the distance over five rounds at UFC 263, despite Diaz’s slight injury forcing a postponement. Edwards was dominant for the majority of the fight, but he was knocked out by a series of punches in the latter stages of the fifth round. Edwards was declared the winner by all judges (49–46, 49–46, 49–46).</p><h4 style=text-align:justify>2022</h4><p style=text-align:justify>The main event of UFC 279, which was supposed to feature Diaz vs. Khamzat Chimaev on September 10, 2022, was Diaz’s last fight under contract with the UFC. Chimaev was supposed to compete at welterweight, but he came in at 178.5 pounds on September 9th, 7.5 pounds over the limit for a non-title bout.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Chimaev was pulled from his fight with Diaz because he failed to make weight. The main event pitted Diaz against Tony Ferguson. When the battle reached the fourth round, Diaz submitted his opponent with a guillotine choke. Diaz received a second Performance of the Night bonus for this victory. Before his battle with Ferguson, Diaz decided against re-signing with the UFC, making him a free agent after the bout.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJrAqa3Hmplnm5%2BifKO4zqBma2hiZ3xyfI5raWimkamybrDImrFmppWperi70a2faA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./joyce-hyser-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Joyce Hyser Net Worth</span></a>
