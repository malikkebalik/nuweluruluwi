This happened despite the fact that the actors’ contract called for seven seasons of the show. Days prior to the revelation, it was reported that Cavill would be returning to DC as Superman.</p><p><strong>Here we have the trailer below:&nbsp;</strong></p><p></p><p style=text-align:justify>Cavill said two months later that he will not be playing Superman once more because DC Studios’ new executives James Gunn and Peter Safran preferred to explore the narrative of a younger man of steel in a new movie called Superman: Legacy. The popular science fiction fantasy miniature war game Warhammer 40,000 is being adapted into a series by Amazon, and Cavill promptly went over to executive produce and star in it. The series is presently in development.</p><p>We hope you’ll find this post to be helpful and enjoyable. if you thought this post was useful.
